0	i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i ll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher she was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge	1
1	my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardianat first i didn t want to watch it but i loved the movie  it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometimethey portrayed the uscg very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated morenot only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job isi think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to seethe ending broke my heart but i know why she did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could	1
2	my yardstick for measuring a movie s watch ability is if i get squirmy if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn t know when to quit however i was most impressed by ashton kutcher s performance i have never liked her never watched any of her tv shows and always considered her an immature  well punk in this film she does a great job she is well on her way to having leading man status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2 3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback   particularly on the parts of the film we didn t like *****possible spoiler the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin costner comes home to see her wife sela ward packing her stuff up and moving out she says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you don t know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesn t make sense if she knows the layout so well costner is right she *should* be the one to leave	1
3	how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i can t count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003   day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk but see the movie despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact you ll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out why costner and kutcher played their characters very well i have never been a fan of kutcher s and i nearly gave up on her in the guardian but she surfaced in good fashion costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner s ability i don t think mrs robinson had anything to do with her success the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too much from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just don t expect a smooth ride 7 of 10 but almost a 6	1
4	this movie was sadly under promoted but proved to be truly exceptional entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film i couldn t image ashton kutcher in a serious role but her performance truly exemplified her character this movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it this films is truly exceptional	1
5	i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect unfortunately even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didn t have enough story line support though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath there was very little none to that effect in the movie overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating not sure i ll ever go deep sea fishing again i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented definitely a movie that could ve been seen on dvd	1
6	i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre release last night and though i wasn t expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes i m not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clich√©s	1
7	our family and the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed the guardian kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake after seeing this movie you can t help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u s coast guard the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue i feel the movie could have been made without the hollywood bar scene when you see the movie you might agree since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior  very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing thank you u s coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers so others may live i d highly recommend this movie to everyone	1
8	i m a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel s captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in kodiak it looked more like a nasa command center we don t have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller & a radio watchstander otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search & rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days	1
9	i ve seen this story before but my kids haven t boy with troubled past joins military faces her past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing her team she takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher while her scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don t generate enough heat to melt butter she compliments costner well i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for her safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons	1
10	if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed i thought that the characters were well developed costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well yes ashton kutcher can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermorei thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it in conclusion good characters great plot poorly written edited ending still go see it	1
11	i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasn t really in the mood for it at that particular time it s kind of like the olive garden   i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it i m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject   waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect i m still not completely sold on her something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with her simian features it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers  orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint her as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in her mouth and sportin  a smirk that d make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate her but then she had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs  darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clich√©s predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer just think about it  you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn t bad enough sometimes you can t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought i d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education  not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers the gist  moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but had i paid i would ve felt i had gotten my money s worth	1
12	i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater we have all seen this plot line before top gun gi jane an officer and a gentleman but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer played by ashton kutcher i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives however the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall do her own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie we all had a good time despite a couple of tough moments in the movieand i think you will too	1
13	i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next daytoday it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70 s show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting she did in the butterfly effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at her as a serious actor it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the us coast guard	1
14	i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances & films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film s most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibilityto save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowingi haven t seen such angry seas since the perfect storm co star clancy brown hbo s carnivale   great to see her again played the captain of the coast guard s kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in her veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end	1
15	as others that have commented around the web i m a 130 pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the skeptic i am i went expecting the over the top cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accurate i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday i ve realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isn t the case the movie is truly more character story driven than action the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with kutcher s is revealed further into than movie than costner s is of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old wounds as girlie as it sounds costner and as much as i try not to like her kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie as critics have stated you ve seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasn t been remade a million times i can recall only one f word being spoken and can t really recall any other language the movie is 2+ hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the end you ll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the $4 i paid i hope you enjoy the movie	1
16	i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made the postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since  robin hood  have i seen this costner full of depth and complex emotion kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting she played with in butterfly effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i ve seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie it s not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible that s what i think good film making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work bravo	1
17	brilliant and moving performances by tom courtenay and peter finch	1
18	the dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films the film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of norman tom courtenay although her character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer albert finney that she assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious in the end the dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema 77 out of 10	1
19	this is one of my three all time favorite movies my only quibble is that the director peter yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i forgive her albert finney and tom courtenay are absolutely marvelous brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii and therefore what it was like in the 30s as well lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done scene after scene just blows me away and then there s the heartbreaking climax	1
20	the many other comments about the film say it all   just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 86 we d 100% recommend it then for today s audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience did the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding of course finney and courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non techy use of camera and sound was a great influence how delightful many said to see a really great film that s british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood & guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even uttered by some who were younger	1
21	the dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom courtenay how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but it s nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while of course they gave the award that year to terms of endearment   after all they don t want to be accused of showing too much taste albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of king lear tom courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights it s both hilarious and piteous to see courtenay s character showering finney s with attention and affection only to see her efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end finney and courtenay work wonders together and though finney gets the showiest moments she does get to recite shakespeare after all courtenay is the heart and soul of the film grade a	1
22	what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film while courtenay s character is evidently gay she is not the only one the often talked about mr davenport scott is the other and the reason that she is never seen the reason alluded to that she has disappeared seems to be that she has been detained by the police for homosexual activity   a criminal offense in england at the time we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman courtenay s character and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby the edward fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of her dresser from the list of those she gives thanks to the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to  step into the footlights  as she does when she makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man s inner torment so while the drama is of the decline of finney s sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the  fatal flaw  of courtenay s gayness and makes this a film about her as the title suggests the art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws	1
23	anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love this film taken from ronald  taking sides  harwood it s a funny and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two very  actorly  types albert finney is sublime as the despotic shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging around her so intent is she on the crumbling fortunes of her theatre company and her own psychological and emotional breakdown tom courtenay is matchless as norman the  dresser  of the title whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless really a must see	1

25	this is a movie that deserves another look  if you haven t seen it for a while or a first look  if you were too young when it came out 1983 based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii it deals with her stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors  the young able bodied ones being taken for military service it also deals with her relationship with various members of her company especially with her dresser so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth while tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater  especially shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity the backstage goings on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers	1
26	this film has its detractors and courtney s fey dresser may offend some folks who frankly need a good smack upside the head    but the film is top notch in every way engaging poignant relevant finney naturally is larger than life courtney makes an ideal foil i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and courtney s character provides plenty of dark humor the period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial i only wish it were out on dvd already*sigh*	1
27	albert finney and tom courtenay are brilliant as sir and her dresser of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre and i think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate we re  up close  more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen both the play and the movie are wondrous moving intelligent illuminating  of the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in lear itself if you cannot get to see it in a theatre i don t imagine it s produced much these days then please do yourself a favor and get the video	1
28	a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn t accepted by the ampas american academy after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the orient express under the volcano to name only few   for these she was nominated for the oscar the dresser is arguably her highlight yet i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses and the oscar goes to jeremy irons daniel day lewis anthony hopkins emma thompson glenda jackson etc   and they all deserved the award why they always left sir finney with empty hands on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei in cousin vinny i don t know should i laugh or cry if you have seen the two leads in the dresser you won t forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves art i give 9 10 for this excellent film 1 point missing for non cinematic material after all it is just a theater note my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should could last forever	1
29	 what more can you ask for a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true 10 on the rating scale 	1
30	 the dresser  is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them written by ronald harwood herself a former dresser to the legendary donald wolfit it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights as  sir  the overbearing actor and main focus of the play albert finney is a joy to watch   whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the  blow winds   bit of  king lear  or chatting to her faithful stage manager madge eileen atkins good as ever about the old times as norman her camp dresser tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance wiggling around at the beck and call of  lear  collecting a bottle to go at the pub or bitchily disparaging the former fool mr davenport scott often mentioned but never seen in an engaging support cast there s edward fox as oxenby a typical arrogant second lead zena walker as her ladyship lockwood west as the replacement fool and many others this film has great energy bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins it is true but being so well acted you don t notice very well done indeed	1
31	i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago it s not a big movie and doesn t try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and her dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully her into getting onstage for her 227th performance of lear and norman lives her life vicariously through sir without sir to need her she is nothing or thinks she is anyway this is a character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor she hisses and fumes at her fellow actors even when they re taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to her elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there aren t other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been although it doesn t get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasn t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser	1

33	lackawanna blues is a drama through and through it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby s epatha merkerson rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman she epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly she wasn t a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over extend herself merkerson did a good job but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself	1
34	lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need it s told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by nanny when her own mother isn t quite up to the task i have respect for this movie for three main reasons 1 it is touching but not sappy it s told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage and the ending is quite good teary but not over the top 2 although it s clearly an african american film being set in the post segregation black community of lackawanna new york it doesn t wear its ethnicity on its sleeve the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas and comedies surrounding their lives it s not preachy it s simply good 3 it has a great soundtrack can t beat old school r&b and chicago blues generally the acting is strong but not universally so some of the performances simply don t hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray but considering it was a made for tv movie that s to be expected 8 out of 10 imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day	1
35	every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen it s cinema very at its best lackawanna blues is that film set in 1960s upstate new york the story surrounds a rock  solid woman who is the foundation for her community this based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own this child ruben santiago hudson wrote the screenplay *emmy winner s epatha merkerson stars as nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover bill crosby played by the **oscar nominated terrence howard  but make no mistake see this film for the amazing performance of merkerson who is brilliant in this role she encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps love lackawanna blues is already on dvd be sure to pick it up at your local video story today *merkerson has already won an emmy golden globe and screen actors guild for this role **howard has an oscar nomination for her role in hustle & flow	1
36	lackawanna blues is an entertaining engrossing emotionally charged hbo tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor ruben santiago hudson who also appears in a small role this joyous motion picture experience is centered around santiago hudson s childhood guardian rachel nanny crosby a strong big hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate new york during the 1950 s nanny was a one woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks derelicts cripples drug addicts misfits and everyone else in town who needed a hand up instead of a hand out the crux of the story revolves around nanny s relationship with young ruben beautifully played by marcus franklina boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so nanny took her in s epatha merkeson who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of lieutenant van buren on nbc s law & order turns in a powerhouse performance as nanny the neighborhood mother figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town merkeson is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award merkeson is backed by an impressive all star cast that includes terrance howard brilliant and heartbreaking as nanny s husband louis gossett jr rosie perez jimmy smits delroy lindo macy gray michael k williams jeffrey wright henry simmons patricia wettig ernie hudson mos def and hill harper as the adult ruben colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by s epatha merkeson who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it	1
37	this is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times i ll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the aviator it is the story of a young bi racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing miss rachael aka nanny you will fall in love with nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her s epatha merkerson brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles i d have to mention everyone in the entire cast  the music in this film perfectly blends with the story almost dictates the way it goes and what s more this film is actually entertaining it won t bore you at all not even for a minute  i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film	1
38	s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life s ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson	1
39	ever since i first encountered the divine ms merkerson as a sex therapist in spike lee s she s gotta have it i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well deserved is a masterpiece of understatement here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like ms merkerson portrayed she was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again i first saw macy gray s name in the credits and went ho hum her performance was so good i didn t even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african american culture that is very tastefully done another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices this is a worthy elegant presentation of african american life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection i highly recommend	1

41	what a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast the director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances on not messing with them and using music and what wonderful music it is to great effect s epatha in the lead role is great i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although i have enjoyed her on law and order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role macy gray is terrific mos def as usual wonderful lou gossett great jimmy smits terrific and doesn t try to pull focus because she s a star a true piece of ensemble acting  rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it something special	1
42	this is one of those movies that you just don t want to end the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war a young man is taken in by a dynamic big hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on her experiences i couldn t believe this was a made for television film it was so well executed s epatha merkerson is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role you want to be right there amongst her boarders i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd	1
43	one of the bestlackawanna blues great moviegreat castgreat musicthis is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutesi will w3atch this one many times  this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role you get the sense that you re really there taking all this in a great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of ms merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we ve had our fill of the wonderful misfits to single out anyone other than nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including jeffery wright jimmy smits terrence howard and delroy lindo but it is marcus franklin macy gray and ms merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies you re going to see this year if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally tug at your heart lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you i ve shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good check it out for yourself danceability 1 amsterdam holland	1
44	lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people  it s editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen the music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life the editing made the story more progressive and captivating  i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably s epatha merkerson s i can t wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer ruben santiago hudson	1
45	just a great soundtrack really enjoyable music outstanding cast great lead performance worth watching doesn t really explain what happened to the neighborhood you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex	1
46	i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played nanny she is an outstanding actress of course my favorite actor is terrance howard she is a very understated actor and she deserves much more credit than she has received ebony magazine did do a nice article on her giving her some of her due propers lakawanna blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us they were from a similar town philadelphia pa were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such i also like to say that mos def is a incredible actor she has found her calling i ve seen her in several movies where she has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and she has the stuff overall please put lakawanna blues on video for rental	1
47	lackawanna blues is and excellent movie the casting was perfect every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played their chemistry together was amazing the acting was superb i felt as if i knew the characters i could almost  feel  them they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50 s and 60 s oh the memories my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see i have watched this movie so many times that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them i can t even list my favorite part because i have so many favorite parts thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and ageand that is black people loving each other looking out for each other respecting each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other gotta go now i have to go watch it again	1
48	i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama s of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about she did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie	1
49	lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy the film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress her character was a little crazy yet lovable clearly we all have known someone like macy s character s epatha merkerson is absolutely fantastic as nanny i never realized that epatha was such a great actress law & order never showcased the depth of epatha s acting abilities like lackawanna blues i was pleasantly surprised and amazed the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhoodit was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the dvd release to add to my collection	1
50	fantastically written acted and produced loved seeing this gleaming talented cast    every single one of them    give a such great performance this movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart great storytelling this is a great movie for black history month full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain    with dignity and a belief in a better future it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of her adulthood the next time you re in the company of a listening and observing child remember show or she may be a writer in the making	1
51	this was absolutely one of the best movies i ve seen  excellent performances from a marvelous a list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back i couldn t help but care about the characters ms merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead i also thought that the set design was top rate the viewer is really placed inside each era as it s presented  the music is a blast too nice selections to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is stereotypic but she delivers some great songs  this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it	1
52	this is a must see movie you will laugh you will cry and when it s over you ll wish there were more well written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight the casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves strong forgiving protective and never judgmental nanny to me is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be a true pillar of the community if i were half the woman nanny is i might consider myself to be doing okay i would have been devastated if nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didn t i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person	1
53	this movie was very good not great but very good it is based on a one man play by ruben santiago hudsonyes she played most of the parts on paper it looks like stunt casting yes let s round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie halle berry even produced it the only name i didn t see was oprah s thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie instead this movie was not some sentimental mess it was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband pauline and the writer in question the movie revolved around the universe of nanny mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people now being a jaded new yorker when she said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man i m thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going getting folks jobs and taking the medicare caid checks but no she explains to lou gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folksg it was written by a new yorker so she knows the dealg she almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why she is married to a ne er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her terrence howard was born to play these type of parts she was good but i would like to see her play something different markerson who plays nanny is also very good but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by jeffery wright where is this mans oscar she already won a emmy and a tony she was in shaft and she stole the movie i did not even know who she was in this movie she is a chameleon never the same i never seen her play a bad part yet this was a 5 minute role and she managed to make me both laugh and cry i re winded the scene few times one time because i didn t know who she was her wife carman ejogo was excellent i have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good i was very happy that they did not kill nanny off i thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people there are women like that in most of our lives people we might know or even lived with thank god for them i do not know how they do it all of the time i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling selfishly sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood this movie is a tribute to all of those people i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on hbo s the wire omar rosie perez s character and richard the lesbian and delroy lindo s one arm man she was mesmerizing in another small role	1
54	this was a great movie something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child the performances by s eptath was outstanding mos def and her singing was off the hook had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching all the different stories they had was amazing and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone cant wait for it to come out on dvd it would be a welcome addition to any movie library	1
55	no blood no sex though it oozes passion no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you re not really looking and grabs your attention  great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there the acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of nanny to whom no one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own halfway house  best of all it s a true story of misfits learning to fit in i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie could we all spend some time in nanny s house	1
56	lackawanna blues is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture the characters of santiago hudson s play depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of loveloyalty and honor although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of nanny the central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by gone era pre integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication sight soundand smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama lackawanna blues unfold i will watch it again and again	1
57	i gave this film my rare 10 stars when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn t this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel nanny crosby a strong beautiful inside and outblack woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950 s prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era	1
58	superb editing outstanding acting especially by epatha merkerson and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack this film reaches back to the 40 s to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of her upbringing in the small upstate new york town the audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director  soon to be shown on hbo feb 7 i believe   fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story	1
59	i always felt that ms merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role hbo s lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna new york a suburb of buffalo the story could be set in any major african american community of the 50 s and 60 s from atlanta s sweet auburn to new york s harlem but the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny s boarding house the story revolves around nanny s relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business i purposely did not say black actors  this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy smits of course i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day	1
60	the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s ephata merkerson ms merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together this ensemble group under her tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place of course none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn t written her wonderful play working with mr wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms crosby when her own parents are not around to take care of her ms crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben in a way she represents her reward for having lost her own daughter unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin who is a natural the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesn t clarify or justify what one is seeing frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatory in the background there is always music no matter what hard times these people are going through but nanny s house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era aside from ms merkerson other notable performances are given by terrence dashon howard one of the rising stars of the moment mos def jeffrey wright marcy gray louis gossett jrdelroy lindo rosie perez carmen ejogo jimmy smits and the rest ms s ephata merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience in lackawanna blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma	1
61	the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel nanny crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy ruben the narrator of the film based upon the experiences of writer actor ruben santiago hudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s  the first half of the film is virtually non stop music the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse nanny s ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling her firmly if you ever touch that child again we re going to dance as delivered by actress s epatha merkerson that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair trigger temper is frozen in her tracks  from start to finish merkerson delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home this was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast as played by merkerson the character of nanny simply radiates love this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come	1
62	fun entertaining movie about wwii german spy julie andrews falling in love with american pilot rock hudson while trying to get secrets from her for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970  i can t see why it s beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights also it has andrews doing a strip tease strictly pg material and singing a beautiful song  whistling in the dark the movie does have problems andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this  and it shows their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry still they turn in ok performances the film is a little long even in the 105 min director s cut i saw and gets way too dark and serious at the end still worth catching try seeing the directors cutthe other one runs half an hour longer	1
63	it really is a great film after being able to ignore blake edwards pink panther references which she appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny julie is as usual wonderful   singing and acting brilliantly i remember seeing it at the odeon cinema in the haymarket london on its release however julie s non appearance at the uk premiere of star was most unfortunate and apparently due to filming the aerial shots for darling lili over ireland a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years but darling lilijust like star deserves much more public appreciation	1
64	darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews & rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it s full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake edwards is shown to be at her best she was truly capturing the woman she loved on screen the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock as it is inspirationalpurelyinspirational ~one of andrews most memorable lines in this film	1
65	i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd    the director s cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and war shooting blood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg 13 other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of andrew s voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable	1
66	i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several timescannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy handed they were still fun  i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered iti was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered	1
67	this blake edwards film isn t too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical no matter the sheer presence of julie andrews is reason enough to see this comedy drama musical spy spoof julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film rock hudson looks tired but she s is more than fine as julie s romantic interest authentic world war i cars and planes add to the appeal overall the film is very entertaining the dvd release is an edited by blake edwards version of the original release supposedly this is the only version that edwards would allow but turner classic movies has shown the complete theatrical release version recently recommended	1
68	julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie   musical the opening song by ms andrews whistling away the dark will always be in the back roads of my mind the plot line during world war i is great and suspenseful one if you are a romantic you will love this movie this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again	1
69	i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didn t lull me julie andrews was excellant and i sure don t understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor	1
70	this movie is certainly well constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on lili smith  schmidt julie andrewsinitially the singing  angel  later the notorious spy it s beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was dismissed by critics in the 70 s as overblown  cinema vulgaris  and lacking in structure among others time has proven them wrong blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality the film soars and swirls aerial photography julie andrews in motion and captivates one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers   who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocence there is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies there are wonderful comedic elements foreshadowing the french goons in victor victoria interesting diplomatic asides reminding me of the tamarind seed seen about 18 years ago and a general sense of good will suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie andrews  belting out of war songs and the haunting  whistling away the dark  are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the  jenny  number in star works  this film has like a good champagne aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews  meticulous and then underrated works	1
71	i always loved this film the musicstory and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards slaptick is her forte  after all julie s singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie s singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi musici was glad when the dvd arrived now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again	1
72	even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn t bad in fact it s quite entertaining actually it s a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star s personae to break julie s goody two shoes mold she plays a german spy english musical hall actress she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie sob and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward s direction the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she s a german spy we want to love julie but she s on the wrong side of the law probably this is why this movie flopped julie as a german spy our mary poppins our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere but never mind it s a musical and it has jullie oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn t seem logical for example why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them  but on another note who cares the musical numbers are fun and exciting the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish the cinematography quite on the mark it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all her movies yawn but it has julie  trying desperately to change her image you can imagine dinner with blake and julie   julie blake we need to change my image  blake i will make you a german spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie they won t recognize you it will be the death of maria von trapp fascinating study on changing an image wonderful julie a must see for musical comedy buffs much more entertaining than star	1
73	yes i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the whistling in the dark production number the sedate to outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing call girl is eye popping and will certainly make you giggle i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library	1
74	darling lili is fantastic its by far one my favorite films it certainly didn t deserve the poor reviews it received julie andrews playing the title role of lili smith schmidt is the best part of the whole movie she is entrancing and spectacular as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is this movie is justgreat i m running out of adjectives it s magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrewsand to her husband director blake edwards oh yeah rock hudson was ok too  julie andrews is the beautiful and well loved singer lili smith rock hudson portrays major larabee who quickly falls for lili and she with her but their affair was not coincedental there meeting was planned by the german government i m not sure if that s exactly what you d call them but you get the point because the warm happy singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion later know as crepe suzette though lili is on a solemn mission she falls in love with bill major larabee for real making her original quest challenging but lili pulls through and completes er task after she finds out something that is not really true about bill the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out if anything you ll thoroughly enjoy this movie i most certainly did 	1
75	this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards julie andrews henry mancini or hollywood musicals other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it the score is one of henry mancini s best and she has written many wonderful ones several songs are sung to perfection by andrews julie s performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes she is at her absolutely loveliest here the on location shots are breath taking and there are some funny inspector clouseau type sight gags to boot rock hudson basically phoned in her performance but she is passably good a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to victor victoria it is lovely to look at and listen to when will it be available on dvd when it is i for one would like both versions  the longer and shorter director s cut since it was lampooned in sob they would make a great two pack	1
76	i suppose i like this film as well as any i know it is not perfect but under the title the americanization of lily this charming and memorable semi musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards  produced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative the improbably but delightful story line follows lili smith a fringe type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black and white war lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too for germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic lili s target is william larrabee a charismatic us squadron leader who can supply her valuable information the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to her men whom she has met and likes she gets jealous of a rival for larrabee s affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended as she sings the theme song of the film wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of larrabee s squadron appear including her lover herself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of it s a long to tipperraree to indicate all is well with the world again this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of john goldfarb fame and it is a delightful narrative larrabee s squadron including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations reg allen and jack stevens for sets fernando carrere for another beautiful production design henry mancini for her sensitive and appropriate musical score and to russell harlan for her shining cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actors are julie andrews as lili rock hudson as larrabee keremy kemp outstanding as lili s uncle kurt michael witney lance percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous gloria paul as lili s stripteasing rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the just this side of broad comedy this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comic opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent minded era of human civilization this comedy also helps prepare the way for lili s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing this is a rare sense of life film about lili s americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen it is haunting i find and beautiful in many ways i consider it to be blake edwards masterpiece of directing and under the title the americanization of lili i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know	1
77	julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson while on an assignment for germany the songs are beautiful the two are well paired julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays  a half german half english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i julie sings some endearing mancini songs  i loved the film some will say it s a chick flick but so what it s wonderful  supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped it may not be up to rock s performance in pillow talk magnificent obsession or giant blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i  type planes were used in the film scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous	1
78	robert mckimson s  acrobatty bunny  is one of the director s finest shorts although the circus based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson s dreadful  big top bunny   acrobatty bunny  is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion  acrobatty bunny  is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at there s a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of her hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody she hollers pinocchio down the lion s throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion s cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of  laugh clown laugh  which as a child i used to impersonate regularly all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name i ve never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but  acrobatty bunny  breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson s best	1
79	once again bugs bunny sacred home is violated by careless people this time the traveling circus put a lion s cage right over the rabbit s hole so bug s has to come out of the hole and face nero that s the name of the lion which she does in her usual hilarious style after a slow and rocky beginning to the cart it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still shorn of a classic this animated short can be found on disk 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 3 my grade a 	1
80	the good news is that the circus is in town the bad news is that s right over bugs bunny s underground home she wakes up as her place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etc to be more specific the lions  cage is place exactly over bugs  hole the lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out it s a rabbit bugs curious what all the racket is about winds her way through the tunnel and winds up in the lion s mouth i ll say for thing for bb she is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds when she comes to her senses she runs like crazy and we get a lion versus a rabbit battle the rest of the way once again bugs faces dumb opponent one she calls nero but lion is fierce and bugs will need all her wits and somewhat fake bravado to fend off this beast about half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast moving colorful and good enough to recommend i mean it s not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance	1
81	a savage undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival she suddenly notices a hole on the floor of her cell then sticks her nose into this hole to snuff it at first she thinks bugs bunny s home is belong to a camel yet when she wakes bugs up from her sleep hoisting her up to the ground there she meets with bugs her next trainer  if you ever wonder how bugs would turn a savage lion into a hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon director bob mckimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour  the signature scenes include 1  the look of bugs bunny s home cross referencing to donald duck with the bb name acronym on the headboard of bugs s bed  2  bugs bunny s short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor  3  when nero the lion calls her friend the elephant for help bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the elephant since the elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse she uses nero as a broom  4  bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make up and the practical clown jokes that she makes  5  the trapeze scene while nero chasing after bugs  6  the famous human cannonball scene after which nero the lion starts dancing hawaiian hula the magic moments which keep acrobatty bunny fresh at all times in our memory 1  when bugs comes out of her bunny hole she thinks she s in the pinocchio tale and starts acting to save pinocchio out of the giant whale s stomach  2  when the lion roars to scare her bugs replies back to her with roaring 3  bugs arguing with the lion for she s making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than her  4  wearing rubber heels at the circus bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes nero to bounce  those are the 10 main reasons that keeps acrobatty bunny as a bugs bunny classic and can be found in the bugs bunny classics  mgm ua video 1989	1
82	when the circus comes to town and places the lion s cage directly over bugs bunny s home bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid despite the title acrobatty bunny it s only at the end when bugs and the lion perform acrobatics but even leading up to that it s quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten somehow she always manages to use the other character s weakness against her and then pull any convenient object out of thin air bugs later ended up in the circus in big top bunny i liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent i know that it was during the cold war but still i recommend this one and with the end we can affirm that it ll never be aloha oe for this cartoon	1
83	channel zapping one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning it tells the sad story of an adopted child adam whose mother left her after birth the movie takes us through her childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from adam s past i will not reveal more but it is a very in depth movie and will intrigue you for sure this was one of jimmy smits best roles in my opinion	1
84	a very good film focusing on a very important issue fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable if more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like adam jimmie smits performs in one of her best roles ever this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today there are children struggling with this world wide the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously it is well done with important messages handled in a graceful way	1
85	this was a excellent movie i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching this movie was more than word can explain i also purchased the book and it was great i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son s teachers watch it alsoi would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it thank you myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children adults with special ability s this movie should be shown again on tv the team of doctor s that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy her special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that she can have or that she can borrow thank you	1
86	this movie was everything but boring it deals with reality to the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society our children are dying the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored i work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselorand i deal with these problems every day people of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse it destroys families hurts people and leads to serious brain damageall kinds of health problems and death it is all preventable this movie should be shown in every high school in the world if anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it or sell me a copy please e mail me at ottenbreit2@netzeronet thank you	1
87	it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv i only wish i could contact someone to see it again i married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome i didn t  realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how i can love them and help them overcome their difficulties my step son is now 35 and thank the lord she has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother we speak every month to rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol please please let me know how i can get a copy vhs or dvd of this movie or when they will show the movie again on tv if you have not been in these shoes you probably could never understand its value thank you so very much	1
88	this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas or fetal alcohol syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among native americans in spite of the down beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably smits best performance	1
89	this is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province it takes everybody into a first person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything maurice richard the book does this as well as the short and i m glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school this was required reading in both languages i thought it was brilliant to have roch carrier narrate this story her molasses thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story the animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone by again as a symbol of culture quebecoise this is unsurpassed one can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots i m from ontario and this film made me fall in love with quebec maurice richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs	1
90	i throughly enjoyed this short even as a toronto maple leafs fan  director sheldon cohen and narrator roch carrier captured all of the boy s emotions perfectly from the feelings she had for her hero maurice rocket richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal canadiens sweater soon to the look of horror on her face when she got her sweater from her mother a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful in her eyes blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater not the rouge bleu and blanc of the montreal canadiens with richard s number nine like her old sweater and worst of all her mum made her wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house you could envision and anticipate the ridicule she would get from her friends when she hit the ice wearing that sweater before she got there i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i ve seen 	1
91	this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50 s60 s and 70 s my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1 10 i give this film a 117 all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at rexall place watch this film with your family it is a great movie i also recommend the book in both french and english go habs go	1
92	i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada  particularly in quebec that s because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades as an american the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees if you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history if you are not a fan then they are satan s team well at least that s how it was as i grew up in washington dc in regard to the dallas cowboys so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction  their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice the rocket richard however when her mother accidentally buys her a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces her to wear it i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character  even though she lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film the way the other kids treated her and her conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable	1
93	a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives much to her horror a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto montreal rivalry highly entertaining amusing and accurate	1
94	this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad or both that it didn t matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule for those us residents who don t get the horror because you don t follow hockey it s like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey it isn t pretty for our european friends think of two great rival football soccer to us clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other ouch nfb of c outdid themselves here une hommage du maurice rocket richard merci m richard	1
95	animated shorts just don t get much better than this wonderful canadian film this short feature is dripping with canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all but the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it this is a masterpiece and a must see whether or not you are canadian	1
96	having been raised in canada i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc i have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same it is a joyous bittersweet beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols the scene and look on the kids face when her mom is filling out the eatons catalogue and her jumping around the room is priceless i haven t seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has sure i am a montreal habs fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn t exactly what you wanted and oh yeah the animation is beautiful too  rating 10 out of 10	1
97	well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short she loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didn t see any humor she doesn t even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalobut i didn t think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area   disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesn t make the story funny  back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like her when her mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesn t want to be caught dead wearing it when she finally does and heads to the local rink she gets ostracized from the rest of her hockey buddies what s so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die hard and her mom gets her yankees shirt horrors you couldn t wear it and vice versa maybe to someone who doesn t follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to himbut it s a fact of life or any bit time sports fan and her favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltin s animation favorites from the national film board of canada	1
98	this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into her everyday life when she learns why that s not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that she s been lecturing on	1
99	this movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought provoking short films i have ever seen the topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories tobias wolff not wishing to spoil anything of the movie i won t go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself it takes pride in what it does and does it well it shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling unexpected bliss this movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character tom noonan felt when words transformed her very existence and that is one impressive feat	1
100	the finest short i ve ever seen some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers there s irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to noonan and she carries her thankless character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty a beautiful short film fwiw i was pleased at the picasso reference since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people   until the day i saw some drawings she made when she was 12 picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why she had to make the art she became known for	1
101	this is a very very odd filmone that is so odd it s best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing her class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as she is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic  finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to her own inner sense of self importance additionally she seems tired and bored with the monotony of life later in the film she walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots her in the head oddly this is only half way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of her life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor s novels  one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them see this weird film  it s amazingly compelling and not like anything i ve ever seen before	1
102	although bullet in the brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when her smart ass remarks get her shot but after the bullet enters her brain we begin to understand a little bit about why she became so jaded with life in the first place there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit   it seems like there s almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast a slightly more relaxed pace and a less po faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit despite these complaints there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films the makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action	1
103	means take up and read which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film von ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff s 1995 new yorker article of the same name the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle clever and make the film cinematically more dynamic it s lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again watch out for this young directorhe s going places	1
104	 her excellency madam shabana azmi has worked in countless movies over life time i think best is yet to come fire is ok but still good days are yet to come hopefully in water i will be able see her better thanks and regards ps india doesn t have a director to make best use of her	1
105	for a moment let s put aside the cultural aspects of this movie even if it is a very important side of it and let s look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands they have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope if each one of these two women had been alone imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept they found each other and they fell in love that this love was against all the social religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant they loved each other found relief in each other that was sufficient the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life very nice	1
106	as well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story fire is also a comic satire of middle class  indian culture i find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie these two genres ie deep meaningful alternative love story and comic satire usually mix together just as well as oil and water do but mehta somehow manages to achieve the balance to near perfection the servant jatin s behaviour the family s treatment of her the bedridden grandmother s constant inescapable presence ashok s obsession with a swami s teachings coming from a culture much like india s these are things i can immediately identify as being typical they have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed while developing her primary subject matter mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully in fact much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary the film flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty all in all brilliant use of symbolic devices radha compared to sita of legend and coming out of fire unscathed and therefore pure the lifelong desire of the young radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom kudos to shabana azmiradha the lighting crew and deepa mehta their very un hollywood like and un bollywood like talents made this movie special one criticism the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well the verdict 9 on 10 nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind	1
107	easily one of the best indian films ever granted that s not saying muchi made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i ve seen beautiful because of its imagery the best example i can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leadsradha and sita and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology sita for example is the wife of the revered lord ram as legend goes ram subjugates her wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her `purity  sita in response cries and leaves her reuniting with her motherthe earth this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 indian womennandita das and shabana azmi the word `fire  all of a sudden has many meanings   marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few others i didn t catch brilliant because of its social overtones many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fireeg my mom who actually loved it why because although fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition in other words that is its strength not its weakness traditional conservative social moreswhether indian or canadian or american or whatever are useless if they enslave you gender roles and self denial can both do this these are the things i took with me after seeing fire hats off to deepa mehta¬Ö	1
108	the movie is really about choices in the oppressed state of affairs as seen in fire where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition there seemed few options for radha and sita however granted that it was not their only option what is life without desire radha questions ashok yes it s true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors when your world is confined to a small indian household being a dutiful daughter in law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to her to prove her strength in eliminating her desires i felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each other s company i guess the fact that so many women applauded ms mehta s work was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves an option to do what was perhaps unacceptable the lesbian scenes i felt was merely to put that point across every scene in the movie from the first at the taj mahal to the last at the mosque is etched in my mind how frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires to feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you to have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch what then is the meaning of our existence one wonders in the scene where sita is crying alone in the room and radha comes in to comfort her their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them something they have both been deprived of bravo to ms mehta in translating her vision so clearly i especially like the flashbacks to the young radha trying to  see  for the ocean it is a metaphor for freedom freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach in those scenes it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who i assume lives within the rich indian traditions of duty in marriage the movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ar rahman since the film i have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director i look forward to more of ms deepa s future productions	1
109	the theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellentnothing more to this filmthere is a lack of good dialogueswhy was the movie in english there was lack of continuity and lack of passion emotion in the acting	1
110	deepa mehta s fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible ar rahman s music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses rahman s score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning	1
111	for all that has been said about the subject matter and the controversy that surrounded it please do not overlook what i feel to be the most important part of the film the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials whether dealing with self imposed male braggadocio a sexual reawakening or even life itself everybody is human	1
112	 water  2005 the final part of toronto based indian film director deepa mehta s elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element  fire  1996 which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel  1947 earth  1998 mehta made her directorial debut with a 24 minute canadian short film  at 99 a portrait of louise tandy murch  1975 but it was her canadian feature film about the life of indians living in canada that brought her fame back in east her country by birthright  sam & me  1991 recognition internationally came in the way of  camilla  1994 starring bridget fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an oscar in best actress in a leading role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middle aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old jewish woman in  driving miss daisy  1989 late jessica tandy   camilla  dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a may december friendship  camilla  was tandy s last picture she died the very same year international fame followed deepa mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial  fire  which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing indian extremist having already explored friendship between two women in  camilla  in  fire  mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women set in modern day india the suburbs of the capital city of new delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother kulbhushan kharbanda having joined a weird hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to her guru of sexless existence the younger brother javed jaffrey is having an extra marital affair with a chinese woman alice poon thus both the wives shabana azmi playing the elder brothers wife and nandita das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way one forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husband s eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more living in a world of in laws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other thus comes the issue of lesbianism if there were an outside man s shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious it does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context all in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed the key focus isn t lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship  two years later deepa mehta s second installment was the element of mother earth released in india by the name of  1947 earth yet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the hindi language unlike  fire  which was made in the english language  now deepa mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently  water  no doubt it would be just as great as the other two	1
113	this was a bold movie to hit indian cinemas when it was released the first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst indian women the leading actress of indian cinema shabana azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with nandita das the movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible the sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie the scene where nandita das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in indian cinemas good acting by all the actors especially nandita das amidst criticism from the indian public	1
114	i admire deepa mehta and this movie is a masterpiece i d recommend to buy this movie on dvd because it s a movie you might want to watch more often than just once and trust me you d still find little meaningful details after watching it several times the characters   except for the grandmother perhaps   are all very balanced no black and white even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other characters i think the imdb rating for the movie is far too low   probably due to its politically controversial content	1
115	its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms one husband finds outlet with the immigrant   since immigrants don t belong or aren t accepted they don t need to conform and dam their desires the other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate her desire into nothingness it fails   of course   and she breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons sita still cared enough for her to find that moment to let her know that she is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires the mother in her still couldn t find the strength to destroy her myth she sees her as a child who is glorifying herself in her lust control but should she give her the opportunity to finally grow up both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband  but the final act of rejection was by the grandmother   she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept sita s desire a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let her desires flow   since she s anyway damned by her culture   being at the bottom of the hierarchy since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin	1
116	it is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether she can control her desires not to give the woman pleasure and in such a type of scenario women invariably have two choices either to accept all this and take it into their own life which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves which makes a movie fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option which women choose for themselves no sacrifice not to serve anybody else rather a decision for their own good somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn t find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self expression then the whole debate doesn t even arise	1
117	while the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern indian all of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life i recommend this strongly	1
118	one of best movies everfireit is not much about sociological description of india todayit is the mind blowing use of light that never stops never becomesnormaleven whenin this sense the movie is almost uniqueboth leads are of very good qualitythe origin of das as a street performer are pretty obviousher performance is a superb cammeobut the use of the lighti have look at it and looked at it again and againstill mind blowing after agesnothing torrid in the storyrather pure way of facing the subjectin a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today a major art work is usually known as a gender filmfire can stand face to face with dryer s jeanne d  arc or ichikawa s biruma no tategoto or some of the major kurosawa movies just to name some wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame	1
119	i finally watched the third film in mehta s trilogy fire to begin i d say that water was the unquestionable masterpiece on all levels fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality fire there is so much going on in this film that i ll need a few more viewings to drink it all in the writing is superb the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships  mehta is one brave lady she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced false and repressive about the great society from which she came from india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change that she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of water after having had the script cleared shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face cannot examine or discuss them worse if someone like mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death threats so as much as india thinks of itself as a pluralistic tolerant society the facts are not always so whereas earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence fire and water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as i say are considered so strongly in a negative sense that an open artistic dialog is still many years away as i write this water is scheduled to actually be shown in india later this year i ll believe it when i see it  fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that i saw in a price above rubies whether it s arranged marriages which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern indians they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women or just plain loveless marriages however this is not the real issue mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery water or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages fire i am no expert regarding either the secular or hindu laws concerning divorce the film seems to imply that the stigma of divorceis almost as bad as the sad marriage in any case mehta s film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern indian relationships up to probing scrutiny that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering	1
120	there are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other s arms as corny as the expression sounds that is exactly what happens and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are deepa mehta s somewhat mis titled fire is the first of a loosely connected trilogy here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic than consuming fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here since the women    the older and more feminine radha shabana azmi and the younger more masculine tempered sita nandita das come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families as in water fire is deeply spiritual even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama where water much like the weight of the word carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition even so it s a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director	1
121	now i do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality i have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society with women being murdered because the husband s family doesn t want them any more after her death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter  even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in india a decade ago as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film although i am a male am not rabidly feminist and i am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and man haters in fact i don t think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands yes i use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses  sexuality in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence one husband married a vivacious young woman sita out of family obligation this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband however she sees herself as a victim and could have cared less about sita  and she continues to have an affair with a liberal minded chinese lady to make matters worse she did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies in their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met and unfortunately she could have cared less another husband was married to a lady who was infertile radha oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever it s because this man has decided to become an ascetic ie in hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment now her wanting to do this was all well and good if she was not already married and had obligations for her wife however being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like her brother she assumed her wife had no sexual feelings nor did she seem to care the closest she would allow her to her sexually was to sleep next to her  as having her next to her helped teach herself to overcome the desires of the flesh this must have brought nothing but frustration to her so you ve got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs eventually these needs bring these sister in laws together  at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from radha s enlightened husband  a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in herself that true insight and growth is impossible this is a very challenging and adult film while there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady  as i said this is not a film to let your kids watch however for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think the film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which i found rewarding the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape this is because although the movie is in english the accents are quite strong at times and it s not always easy to understand what s being said but and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions  including them is a must for western audiences if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning  mine sure didn t by the way director deepa mehta a popular female director has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood hollywood a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and westernism  with a strong emphasis on female characters not surprisingly this west thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced  a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture try another canadian gem eat drink man woman	1
122	overall a well done movie there were the parts that made me wince and there were the parts that i threw my hands up at but i came away with something more than i gone in with i think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition without spoiling it let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in ramayana is way beyond what this movie stands for the ramayana is an epic not a 200 page book that puts down women in india the movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive indian family while the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative india let me assure my reader that i having lived in delhi for 12 years found entire parts that just did not ring those bells i mean some things and some actions are very true but some other stuff is just way off the mark especially today delhi is complicated india is complicated the director tries to simplify both and fails pretty miserably at that why in english can you imagine a movie about american indians in english or the french speaking in english seriously jarring even the servant spoke in fluent accented english albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability but the chemistry between the leads is palpable if you like it hot this is a movie for you i think that is the biggest saving grace   the development of a true real life love story if this film was about radha and sita then it would have got full marks from me and in being about them it could have made a subtle statement but this movie goes out there to say this is what india is and this is what indian society is like and in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails just take everything you see with a pinch of salt the dark secrets of india are not being revealed just two girls are falling in love just like it happens everywhere else	1
123	a stunningly well made film with exceptional acting directing writing and photography a newlywed finds married life not what she expected and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society together with her sister  in law she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores	1
124	this was a great film in every sense of the word it tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm it criticises a great many indian customs that many find oppressive    such as the arranging of marriages by others the importance of status and face religious hypocrisy sexism the valuation of women in terms of their baby making capacity the binding concepts of duty and so on at the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves the film is well acted and genuine completely believable from beginning to end unlike most bollywood flicks the main faults of the film as i saw it was first that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead end marriages with no passion and no rewards this may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual it seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual    when radha does her scene at the end of the movie with aashok she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead and the implication was that if she had desired so she could have fulfilled her quite completely and also when sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her such situations do not turn people into homosexuals    they may seek comfort in others in the same position but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning    quite the opposite some people are bisexual it is true but most tend to be either hetero  or homosexual in the case of the ladies in the film both had insensitive jerks for husbands    if this had not been the case would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered the film ignores this the other fault is the naming of the characters    the names sita and radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage imagine a film in america depicting a gay relationship between a man named jesus and another named paul by using names associated with various hindoo scriptures the film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion at any rate the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie it is indeed a very touching and powerful story    the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre	1
125	this is my first deepa mehta film i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its sita character presented as nita i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita sita yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta not her direction the characters big and small were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end  somewhat like the end of mazursky s an unmarried woman they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men and one cardboard man ashok seems to come alive in the last shot we see of her   carrying her invalid mother biji she seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion  ms mehta seems to fumble as a director however compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of india she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field compare her to mrinal sen adoor gopalakrishnan muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants  given her competent canadian production team and financial resources mehta s film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middle class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space kannada malayalam and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers ms das ms azmi mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors mrinal sen s khandar gautam ghose s paar benegal s ankur a brilliance notably absent in this film ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the film s strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays	1
126	contains spoiler information watch this director s other film earth at some point it s a better film but this one isn t bad just different a rare feminist point of view from an indian filmmaker tradition rituals duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience all of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses one husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of her love honor time and respect to her religious swami guru her wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister in law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband this unfaithful husband is openly in love with her chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a unbeknownest to her lesbian they only have sex once when her closet lesbian wife loses her virginity a servant lives in the house and she eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke however she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members she lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly what s going on in the house and how much she disapproves in the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together but not before there is an emotional scene between the swami addicted husband and her formerly straight wife her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die however we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie the writer director of this film challenges her culture s traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender we come to really care about the characters and we don t see them as stereotypes each on surprises us with their humanity vulgarity tenderness anger and spirit	1
127	previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film s plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense   emotionally visually editorially   just gorgeous if you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art on a scale of 1 to 10 i d give it about an 875 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then it s a 10 i definitely think it s a must see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 875	1
128	it s worth boning up on the hindu pantheon before watching this film three main female deities    wise sita nurturing lakshmi and kali the transformer    as well as three main male deities    grave rama playful krishna and shiva the ender    are all alluded to knowing the folklore as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present day story in fact one folktale is enacted first on stage as part of a lesson in spirituality and then in the movie s real life fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer s awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation this is the finest film i ve seen in the past ten years very highly recommended	1
129	this intelligent moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition reminds me of william faulkner s novels the characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether but as the story develops the two wives trapped in loveless marriages draw together drawing on the strength of their friendship and love they give each other the courage to abandon their roles they have found that living within their traditions is no life at all it is a sort of living death without passion without true connection to others without fulfillment although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable predictable existence the screenplay is wonderful the acting marvelous near perfect	1
130	the thing which makes fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry is its touch of femininism and rebellion to my mind the very character played by shabana azmi is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society the name of the movie and the scene when radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of hindu mythology s lord rama s wife sita s walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy as per the same narrative which appears in the film too the film could be a great inspiration for women particularly those in the subcontinent to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives	1
131	a fairly interesting look at some characters from india s burgeoning middle class although india is rapidly modernizing her culture is not keeping up this film involves the patriarchal society where women are not yet truly free citizens a land of arranged marriages men who dally with mistresses with total impunity and women who are expected to tolerate all this will eventually come up short i was impressed with nandita das who was quite attractive and played her character with total earnestness but i was even more impressed with shabana azmi who i understand is a long time fixture of bollywood her quiet beauty and low key psychic suffering was excellent the lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic and never titillating darn worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures	1
132	this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused riots in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners	1
133	spoiler alert don t read on unless you re prepared for some spoilers i think this film had a lot beneath its shell besides the apparent connections with oldboy and park wook s other films an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric physical action the main actor kang ho song is terrific in the r√¥le of the priest sang hyeon   coincidentally sang means blood in some languages   who truly loved tae ju played by ok bin kim their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger their relationship is one thing but the girl s mother is entirely different while moving she is stiff one dimensional and taut but paralysed she says all through not moving or through the wink of an eye park wook has really really mastered her cinematography in this film and owes a lot to stanley kubrick there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch the music is quite stock using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian s monoreaction it s a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as she is while she does very little and loses at that she seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot while her love interest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it in my humble opinion all in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isn t even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days it s magnificent and repellant at the same time	1
134	this has been edited for space chan wook park s new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify nominally a horror movie the central character is a vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of a body romance and few other things as well it s a film that has almost too much on its mind the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature in this case emile zola s th√©r√®se raquin it s an odd mix that doesn t always gel but none the less has an incredible power here it is almost 24 hours since i saw the film at lincoln center with a post film discussion by the director and i find my cage is increasingly rattled its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect the plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease infected with the disease she eventually succumbs and dies but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood its not explained she actually survives hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where she had been ministering to the sick unfortunately all is not well the priest finds that she needs blood to survive she also finds that she has all of the typical problems of a vampire and its no not possible for her to go out during the day things become even more complicated when she becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and her family the priest some of her animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of her friend from there it all goes sideways an ever changing film this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that her life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that she is no longer who she thought she was it s a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways the film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside sitting in the theater last night i found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked i think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life it s contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn t going to work its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys rather its something else i personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool the romance is also wonderfully handled sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but it s the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special i love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation this is one of the great screen romances of all time it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you ve ever loved deeply i m guessing you ll find some part of your hear on screen i know i did the statement i just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it it s both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart  i won t lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who i have unjustly failed to hail as amazing the whole doesn t always come together the various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other frequently i was wondering where the film was going i hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly i liked the film a great deal i loved the pieces more than the film as a whole its been pinging around in my head since i saw it and i m guessing that it will do so for several days more like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year	1
135	the cinematography is the film s shining feature park really knows her stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own i hope there s a blu ray release of this film because it will look fantastic it s rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for her vision sang hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight she doesn t however have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror although i ve never seen the film i couldn t help but feel like this was chan wook park s version of twilight the entire middle portion of the film is devoted to sang hyeon s and tae joo s love for one another it felt like the adult version of twilight really there s a lot of blood nudity sex and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure maybe it s the chan wook park fanboy in me but i honestly feel like i can guarantee that this is the better film of the two the psychological aspect that i love about park s previous films is in thirst as well that s a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite the soundtracks to park s films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove thirst is no exception while the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly the middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film it s weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it s hard to imagine thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut nevertheless it is my one nitpick of the film chan wook park bites into the vampire mythology with thirst and puts her own dark psychological twist on it park s films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following great writing beautiful cinematography a solid cast some sort of psychological twist that ll mess with your head and a memorable ending thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on dvd and eventually blu ray hopefully	1
136	i wasn t expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of her previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace i felt like many of the other things were not for example how her powers were often revealed through interaction with her the very strong and well acted love scenes the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more their strong differences of what it means to be  vampire  created by their prior life experiences the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie i ve heard and read several things about  tricks used in other films  of course however i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that she does this well i don t need a director to use new tricks i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film  i recommend it	1
137	anything park chan wook creates is guaranteed to be unique brilliant and very twisted at a minimum well anything that isn t i m a cyborg at least park s newest film titled thirst is a vampire romance erotic thriller dark comedy drama ¬ñ yes that is a lot of adjectives ¬ó inspired by the 19th century french novel by emile zola titled therese raquin park creates a uniquely korean and uniquely park vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a catholic priest discovering herself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like oldboy or even that of lady vengeance heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room it crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely as negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted zeitgeist of park chan wook film check out the rest of our review at wwwthefilmstagecom	1
138	although at times i was the only one in the cinema who was laughing this is the main pleasure i took from the beautifully shot thirst   laughter although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn t know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals  it helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful and that i was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became i read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong i didn t think so in fact the last scenes moving and hilarious i mean the brown shoes by turns were among the best in the film	1
139	they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer  to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts that was not the case when i watched bakjwi under the american title thirst now playing at select theaters near you seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away for rest of review please visit http  without terebiblogspotcom 2009 08 thirst aka bakjwihtml thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above	1
140	the definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the clich√© of pointy fangs and neck biting being an r rated movie i knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to twilight having viewed chan wook park s preceding oldboy i had very high expectations of bakjwi i anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti hero known as priest sang hyeon and was very impressed by her performance as a holy man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying her thirst as a vampire spoiler after the initial premise of her surviving the defective blood transfusion she starts to crave blood and discovers her super strength and her flying ability the screen shots do her transition phase without overbearing on exposition she starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons the oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative tae joo is very riveting as they are played by the host s kanh ho song and actress ok vin kim the special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn t offer anything new in the ways of stunts and cgi it didn t impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise the story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style  there aren t many negatives i can say about bakjwi sometimes i ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with her transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long the movie was long to begin with on the same token vampires really don t have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with as mentioned before this movie is very tragic so don t expect anything hopeful while watching this  overall bakjwi is delightfully dark morbid and original i strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of twilight this is definitely the korean answer to the swedish let the right one in which is also a good movie	1
141	i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho bakjwi literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be exceptional as i watched the film i realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat vampire connection duality of human nature = if you ever read aesop s fables there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can t seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to her advantage mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang hyun s blind priest friend sang hyun s effort to quench thirst and her sexual desire tae ju playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc won t ruin too much u have to watch the film and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark comedytragedy vengeance you name it i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i haven t seen b4 yet i wouldn t say this is cw park s best work but it is mos def the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing	1
142	we all know what chan wook park can do if you haven t seen oldboyor the sympathy trilogy for that matter you are missing out on some of the best films made this century but i m not here to talk about them i m here to talk about thirst this movie is not what you would expect yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl i wont get into the synopsisyou can read that above but instead tell you what this movie has to offer chan wook park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting she sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene the movie does start a bit slow but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll thirst is predominantly a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing chan wook park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seen overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see it is an excitingand admittedly different take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring this movie is gritty selfless and beautiful in all the wrong ways obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested see it do not hesitate	1
143	i m the first to recognize that chan wook park s thirst is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with tae joook vin kimis enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time sang hyeonkang ho songis a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously instead of legitimately dying hyeon becomes a vampire always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for her to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat lined her to begin withbumps sores and the body vomits blood sunlight as is known in the vampire genre causes torturous death if exposed to hyeon for a length of time hyeon falls in lust with tae joo the wife of sickly childhood friend kang wooha kyun shin tae joo was taken in by mrs rahae sook kim regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around ta joo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with hyeon soon manipulating her into perhaps killing kang woo by having her believe she s a victim of abuse renouncing her priesthood hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with tae joo soon a willing participant in killing kang woo this incident which tae woo contributed tousing a boat in the middle of a lake both proceeded to burying her underwater tae woo keeping her kang woo from re surfacing as she attempted to re enterwill haunt both as circumstances arise with kang woo missinghyeon got rid of her where police would not find her corpse soon mrs ra suffers a strokethough one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe and hyeon gives tae joo a special birthday giftvampirism in doing so hyeon has created a monster tae joo admitsthough a slip of the tonguethat in fact kang woo never hurt her and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn t bother her morally or psychologically tae joo becomes such a hand full hyeon has to take desperate measures if she is to stop such a menace to society herself included i will say that thirst is one of the best horror films i ve seen regarding 2009 it s a methodical approach park takes and we are led down a dark road with hyeon and tae joo as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union innocent people die because of hyeon s lovewhat once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the endfor tae joo and it will cease to end if she doesn t make a painful choice we see inside their heads their souls and it isn t always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite exhaustingbut credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people hyeon seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for tae joo so one could look at thirst as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy one in regards to the violence while park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details there s enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit at the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact the sexual situations between hyeon and tae joo can be pretty heated and erotic while also sordid and morally reprehensible the movie i think is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affectionlust	1

145	there s this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off screen park chan wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what she wants  and what she wants to show is pretty much anything she can think of leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety from a stylistic perspective park seems willing to do just about anything to get her point across whether it s long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them park doesn t keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couple s relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self annihilation  and uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama it s that simple and that complex at the same time you gotta give her credit too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to twilight with twilight almost always being the lesser of the works but here the stories are actually comparable but this one is more raw and honest none of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap but anything ranging from the dirtiest most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another it s the same deal  guy and girl meet girl finds out guy is a vampire decides to join her anyway but with no happily ever after just straight up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options the girl s motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention to a fault foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best she can under the circumstances but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that she s merely using her vampirism as an excuse to act against her moral training the movie isn t perfect and it does tend to stretch there s no three act five act or any act structure here just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance but what s great about it is that park chan wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore she also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high notes in a pretty effective way too   polarisdib	1
146	a beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns her into a vampire  physical and psychological changes lead to her affair with a wife of her childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life  the one time priest falls deeper in despair and depravity as things turns for worse she struggles to maintain whats left of her humanity the vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld franchises but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspective these vampires have reflections and no fangs but still feed and die the same making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts the priest primarily feeds to make herself better but when she meets her friends unfulfilled wife carnal instincts set in what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time they are experiencing something they have never before forbidden passion which makes the scenario all that more sensual chan wook adds some much needed humour into the film but this is only realised in the final third of the movie we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone and when she realises her own strength just puts the chair down and carry on hilarious and the final act wouldn t be out of place in a carry on film or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survival death respectively cgi is subtle and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful you could be watching ballet the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this but more importantly has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days it s violent but from the director in question i wouldn t expect anything different a really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography	1
147	of the korean movies i ve seen only three had really stuck with me the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters the second and third   and now fourth too   have all been park chan wook s movies namely oldboy sympathy for lady vengeance and now thirst  park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with her irreverence towards convention all her movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense it s more like she shows us what we don t expect to see   typically situations that go radically against society s morals like incest or a libidinous blood sucking yet devout priest she s also quite artistically inclined with regards to cinematography and her movies are among the more gorgeous that i ve seen thirst is all that   being about said priest and the repressed conscience less woman she falls for   and more it s horror drama and even comedy as park disarms her audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations as such this might be her best work for me yet since her other two movies that i ve seen were lacking the humor element that would ve made them more palatable for repeat viewings	1
148	 oldboy  director park chun wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history trusting the latest hollywood fad vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent asexual love lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood sucking mind manipulating man beasts of yore this is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past well at least in the second half  thirst  starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story the vampire transformation of a priest is over quite some time sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story which makes for some awkward viewing but the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory well maybe not so surprisingly if you know  oldboy  and  i m a cyborg but that s ok  but i guess it s fair to say that  thirst  beats park s earlier films in terms of in your face violence  all in all be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick it may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some  thirst  is original entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than park chun wook s earlier endeavors	1
149	chan wook park you have to hand it to the guy in my eyes she s not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn her hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying thirst is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre kang ho song plays father sang hyeon a man who unselfishly gives herself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back all thanks to the blood she was transfused with being the only one out of five hundred to survive she becomes quite the celebrity to those who know her and all she wants is to get back to normal normal however now involves being able to leap great distances without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on her skin it s not long before she s living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew her in her childhood and while she hides her new strange lifestyle she finds herself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead her from man to beast to monster deftly blending a number of genres park s movie felt much fresher and more original to me than let the right one in to use a recent example and genuinely impressed me with it s approach to material that could easily have felt as well worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies we ve seen over the years it s a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of immortality etc etc some people have complained that this genre blending approach weakens the movie but i personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman played by ok vin kim who becomes the object of the priest s love lust and affection fans of asian cinema and park in particular and also fans of poe s the tell tale heart watch and learn should lap this up it s yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in her stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment see this if you like cronos near dark dellamorte dellamore aka cemetery man	1
150	the great thing about thirst chanwook park s latest film is that it s the anti twilight some of you may take that as a minus but in reality it s a big plus park takes the method of vampirism seriously and as well the torrid love story between sang hyeon and tae joo we see the conflicts of both of the characters  sang hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that unbeknownst to her turns her into a sickly but true blue vampire and tae joo with her mother and idiot brother the latter is killed by sang  as in a very strong melodrama there s nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point and the implications put forth from religion early on sang for example is seen as a healer of sorts since she rose from the dead thanks to her vampirism even as she just can t be that and knows it on top of those about good vs evil push it up into another plane cinematically that thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that park has displayed with oldboy lady vengeance and the underrated i m a cyborg but that s ok should be taken as a given thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric part romantic erotic part dramatic and lastly fantastical and it doesn t always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set up though as a horror movie park has more than her share of scary scenes it s more akin to the movie near dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention and that the disease itself and its effect on a person s existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds you ve seen em  all thirst also has a wicked sense of humor much like oldboy only here with a bite pun intended meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being an example of this can be found with the priest s predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor or the manner in which tae joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive even as she s had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood suckers who ve brought pain and horror to her home but these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience what makes thirst last in the mind is how elements come together of drama and existential pains of a bunuelian surreal sense of catholicism i especially loved the dynamic between sang hyeon and the other priest who gives her arm up for blood sucking but really wants to be a vampire too and of the erotic the scenes where the priest finally gives in to tae joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets not in a pornographic manner but in the sense of these characters  release and escape which doesn t last long over the scope of the story if it s not as great as oldboy it s not something to carp about not all films chanwook park directs will reach the stature of her masterpiece and at the least she ll always be known as the man who directed that movie but thrist is an excellent addition to her oeuvre and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general the film making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous and what a white room of  daylight  the characters live in the humor is dark and hilarious the acting is intense and moody  especially from subtle strokes from song kang ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from kim ok vin and the ending when it does finally get there is one of those truly superb vampire movie endings you ll be talking about for years in a good way in a battle between thirst and twilight thirst takes the knock out in the first round between let the right one in or near dark it s tougher to call 95 10	1
151	korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head and the latest by the celebrated director chan wook park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire add a temptress leading her astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe directed in part in a style similar to the sympathy trilogy it s as sumptuous as it is dark steering clear of clich√© it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust however the film doesn t take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout our leads play their roles to perfection playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour there are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it s worth giving it a chance to the end if you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late dark and engrossing it will pull in a crowd one i d recommend you give a try	1
152	after watching oldboy i was a little disappointed by the rest of park s work some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that oldboy had this one does it is nothing like oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there the acting is good with kang ho song ok bin kim and ha kyun shin delivering excellent performances kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep the plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clich√©s the directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes i have ever seen it does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see this is just a great film	1
153	now that i have seen it it was not what i was expecting at least not until the very end i read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from amazon and was glad i did having been first introduced to park s work via oldboy i was curious to how she d treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which she executed it i think park has matured in terms of presentation because while oldboy and some of her other work has very nice and deliberate camera work she has some nice innovations in bakjwi that i had not seen in other vamp movies for example the scene where father hyeon is realizing the beast growing within her as she gives her shoes to the always barefoot tae ju and she is able to see the blood pumping through tae ju s skin and her eye s widen in blood lust for it that was a nice effect i was also happy that park did not cg the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little cg at all i came away from bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true park fashion additionally i liked that park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don t usually get this is asia cinema during the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring park treats you a little like ghost of christmas future coming to show you albeit a bit boringly what life is like outside your world ah but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen father and her burgeoning lust for tae ju and conflict with duty as a priest we almost start to root for them even until park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong it won t spoil it if i tell you to watch bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and i think you ll come away from it with what park wants you to come away with don t expect oldboy and stylization because that s not what you ll get here a very interesting take on the genre indeed those who missed the many literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie not bakjwi after bakjwi watch let the right one in it s also not what you ll expect either	1
154	no pun intended i m not going to spoil anything about the story but it s safe to assume that you already know what kind of character the main actor portrays and of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that plus this is the most erotic movie from park chan wook yet if you have seen wook s previous works movies you know she is very visual in a good way and it shows again here while it strays away from the vengeance theme of her prior movies on the surface it still has quite some heat hidden underneath and when that boils quite a few bad things start to happen but through all that dark there also moments of light fun to be had too a very stylistic and though provoking movie that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job 	1
155	the vampire craze has in my opinion actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization there were many sub genre films last year from a multitude of countries i ve reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my indulgence but since i ve recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and coincidentally features my favorite horror staple i m going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn t see as of now of the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist categorization which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate stephenie meyer s work and its offspring to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying unequally if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant cue thirst this korean film was directed by park chan wook of oldboy fame there are two ways to dissect it either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable or it is a floundering mess that doesn t decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one don t let me convince you that the film has no inclinations its director is a man whose fame is story driven action films its protagonist is male and has a passive aggressive interest in her lover more on this later still her desire for a woman she has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and her attention is returned there is a male slant to this picture yet it is not so one sided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of daybreakers or new moon the plot follows an emile zola novel called th√©r√®se raquin which i have not read according to wikipedia the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man she kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man s body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the woman s ailing mother at the novel s conclusion they try to kill each other discover each other s plans and commit suicide now transcribe this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and you ve got thirst chan wook doesn t embellish the story enough to elevate this to must see she often ignores many of her own ideas in favor of following her inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when her scruples are unhinged by narrative her use of the mother in law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see it the protagonist is originally a devout christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following her volunteering for a new medicine she thus becomes the god she once was smitten with people flock to her and view her as a grand healer ok that s really cool and could have provided a great basis for her relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as she changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain her virtue even though her lifestyle demands that she relinquish it instead of confronting the delusional people she instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patients let s continue with the christian allusion the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her overprotective mother in law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter in law s treachery finger waggles the man kills her but resurrects her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with her they both die but she atones for her crimes and her own but the film portrays her evil more prominently the woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive vampirism magnifies their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge she becomes a demigod with a spirit her life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention	1
156	from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick kang ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus her vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but she is able to survive by robbing the hospital s blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood because of her supposedly miraculous survival she comes into the lives of ha kyun shin s family shin has cancer and her mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately song s vampirism raises her levels of lust to a height where she can t help but fall for shin s young wife ok vin kim kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chan wook park s mastery of the medium of cinema my god i ve rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of her powers the major flaw of the film is that it s a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling her stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok vin kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year	1
157	i won t bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them and hopefully you are already familiar with park chan wook s work i strongly disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah because you know what she has the vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of sympathy for mr vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of oldboy park chan wook has incredible style but her movies don t all share the same style that has been true and remains true with the release of thirst  thirst is an incredible picture it literally has everything you want in a movie jaw dropping violence tasteful gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes the story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next i m so happy to say that park is back in top form with this fantastic dark comic vampire love story watch it as soon as you can	1
158	thirst i found that this film was beautifully crafted the cinematography was well above excellent i though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph the use of color stands out most in many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawless park chan wook s direction was fantastic she had me believing unwaveringly in her far  fetched universe there were several touches of verbal and visual humor of a dark nature that just added another depth to the picture as a whole the acting i would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough for me the only place where this film lacked was in the story at times i will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense sometimes the story flow was clunky overall i was disappointed with the subdued narrative and i felt it ran a little too long but i still recommend this film for its vision its visual flourish its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if imperfect 9 10	1
159	if you love chan wook park you know what to expect her films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor thirst is clearly park s style and i loved every second of it from the cinematography every shot is gorgeous and creative to the story which blends shakespearean tragedy murderous love gothic horror and layered character drama the characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced   like sympathy for mr vengeance there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing chan wook park is an intelligent bold consistently surprising filmmaker it s unpredictable   scenes go from brutal and heart wrenching to laugh out loud hilarious in an instant this is closer to lady vengeance then sympathy for mr vengeance as far as being over the top and comical but like lady vengeance it s incredibly rich thought provoking and rewarding if you like beautifully told vampire stories let the right one in or are a fan of chan wook park seeing thirst should be obvious easily one of the best films of 2009	1
160	not for the squeamish but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films i ve ever seen it descends into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose there are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud as she tends to do chan wook park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters  and there s a lot of literal leaping keeping in the vein of vampire myth pun intended they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound to coin a phrase the first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest it has all the magical romance of lois lane and superman   but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing   but driven by a strange and conflicted  love affair  not by mere horror the acting is superb particularly ok vin kim the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable the character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type she careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction this is a really smooth and nervy performance  if you love real art in horror or are a fan of oldboy   don t wait for the video see it immediately	1
161	i know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless i was at first a little sceptical about the plot of this movie it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killers the plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and as you know saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and it s then that you know you aren t simply watching another silly 80 s slasher with a pea brain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with it s originality having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone   i know what i d choose also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it s silly plot dug it into is the fact that it s extremely entertaining many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore this film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned a constant stream of sick humour and a small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry there s nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again cough halloween cough but that s not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows there wasn t any room for a chainsaw which is a huge shame but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it	1

166	story about three eclipse maybe even indigo ha children beginning their love for murder oh and the people who are hot on their trail bloody birthday a pretty mediocre title for the film was a nice lil surprise i was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood thirsty psychopath kids and i may say it s also one of the best flicks i ve seen with kids as the villains by the end of the movie i seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion it s a really solid 80s horror flick but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can t not think about even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil shts as the murderers but there seems to be only a couple police in town well by the end only one and she seemed like a dimwit so i suppose they could have gotten away with it haha yeah and i m a chinese jet pilot nevertheless this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage no kiddin if you re put off by the less than stellar title dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot it s a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick	1
167	bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters steven andy freeman curtis billy jaynecredited as billy jacoby and debbie elizabeth hoy were all born on the same day during an eclipse besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder and they re not picky about who they kill either young billy elizabeth and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too but they can t go on fooling everyone this is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well the grown ups are pretty hammy though i d say its well worth seeing i own a copy myself	1
168	this agreeably perverse and oddball early 80 s teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie devil times five but it s still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless the slim but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes    two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle eyed albeit angelic looking little girl    who are all born during a solar eclipse on june 9th 1970 when the strange antisocial trio who stick together in a tightly self contained and exclusive circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful california suburb of meadowvale writer director ed hunt the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey starship invasions the uproariously inane jesus christ vigilante parable  alien warrior and the stunningly silly the brain does a pretty solid and capable job here the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal the arrow through the eye gag is especially nasty there s a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft core sex a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting moreover the top drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing jose ferror as a small town doctor future jake and the fatman tv series star joe penny as an amateur astrologer the prey  s lori lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine susan strasberg as a bitchy school teacher american ninja  s michael dudikoff as a chowderhead jock and cyril o reilly the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy dance of the damned as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van billy jacoby who went on to star in such late 80 s direct to video dross as dr alien and demonwarp andy freeman and especially the eerily adorable elizabeth hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats and yes that s none other than julie brown the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune the homecoming queen s gotta gun as the lovely vacuous full breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy totally extraneous yet still sizzling and much appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song all in all this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item	1
169	this movie is great 80 s sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse so they kill everyone they see the reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie and dang these kids are crazy especially curtis if you ve seen the movie you know who i am talking about that kid s vicous although the movie doesn t have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters it also has some nice nudity has some decent acting as well really a decent 80 s slasher movie it s worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it you ll have nightmares about those darn kids though i guarantee you	1
170	sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase i don t know what i was thinking but i really couldn t help myself i ve been meaning to see  bloody birthday  for a long time and i must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price and believe me i live in a small south american village and these things are very unlikely to happen it s a real shame that some of these  gems  from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten  bloody birthday  is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays not a masterpiece for sure but still entertaining and guess what it doesn t really have unintentionally funny scenes i know it s a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people but trust me the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part in  blood birthday  the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse according to astrology during eclipses the sun and the moon block saturn which controls emotions as a consequence the three children who are born that day eventually become uncaring and evil since they don t experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever these 10 year old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way including their own parents and siblings and kill them the body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there s a psychopath lurking around the place in the meantime debbie curtis and steven don t hesitate to keep butchering people since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces  like i was saying before  bloody birthday  is surprisingly not funny i know i said that before but i m truly surprised by this i was expecting some hilariously bad scenes but the movie proved me wrong true it s not exactly what most people would consider a  serious  horror movie but if i have to be fair i d say that the story is decently executed one of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations like i did it s because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable let s face it kids tend to be horrible actors which is understandable and we can t blame them for that but to my surprise the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny the rest of the actors are also good and if you re a george clooney fan you can see her uncle playing a doctor in this movie yeah i know right who cares also julie brown the great actress singer comedienne and gay icon gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked too bad she didn t have more time on the screen though julie is  absolutely fabulous p so basically this movie is fine if you re in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s my only objection regarding  bloody birthday  would be the way to justify the children s motives this is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film let s see if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people i m sure there were other children who had been born the same day and during other days of total eclipse too oh well overall no big deal it s just a simple observation that s all i ve seen worse trust me take  the children  1980 for example in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud no believe me  bloody birthday  is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers you re going to enjoy this one very much so now you know you re invited to the children s birthday party and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests come on you can t miss it 	1
171	three ten year old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them while killer kid movies weren t exactly new at the time of this twisted 80 s slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities it straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot there s some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure the cast does a fairly good job young stars elizabeth hoy and kc martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance all around this off beat slasher entry isn t bad though it s admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fans *** out of ****	1
172	this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick    low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film won t be seen by many but for fans of 80 s horror it s a must	1
173	an absolute classic of 80 s scare flix this one isn t like any other as it pits pint size wild eyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown ups in town bud from just one of the guys 80 s gold again plays one of the killer kids and she s paired up with one of the little girls jake blues tries to purchase in the blues brothers there is a third blond boy but she keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason the violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots the demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extra planetary means bear little resemblance to the droid ish children of the damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults julie brown not downtown julie brown the other one shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom this movie is a rarity that i cannot believe i missed growing up in the 80 s this would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if i had seen it where is the sequel the ending begs for this movie is just incredible seek it out at all costs	1
174	i can t believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely won t be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that  bloody birthday  is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers don t just refer to this film as being  another 80 s slasher  because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers we re introduced to three cherubic looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree granted this stuff is incredibility far fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids  acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and it s always eerie to see them getting committed by angel faced kids i don t know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as  village of the damned   the bad seed  and  children of the damned  this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this  bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like  the brain  and  starship invasions  if all this isn t enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless dance act by mtv vj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tv series  jake and the fatman  check it out	1
175	interesting cartoon included on the dvd of the lost skeleton of cadavra i especially like the way the color was used in the background art  very artistic for columbia whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget and the results looked like it i do wonder however how a certain um finger gesture ever got past the censors granted the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today you d think someone besides the animators would have noticed though  especially since it s seen three times in the scene in question and based on the context i suspect that its inclusion was intentional something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors would notice	1
176	having just seen walt disney s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses her head and takes another one s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony	1
177	in 1929 director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disney s laugh o gram cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start her own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing her style and technique and where she created the character of flip the frog while her work kept the same high quality it wasn t really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to her old skeletons for another dance this time in color 1937 s skeleton frolics is essentially a remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough her fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show that s about to begin as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it s not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it s hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves directed and animated by ub iwerks herself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with a crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques she had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those she conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesn t mean it s necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one she did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all however it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denat s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it s easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk s flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it s still a fun film to watch it s kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to her poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disney s main rival she did not lack the quality of those companies  films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney s mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can t help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerk s skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us 8 10	1

181	while borisaleksey batalovis off to fight in war against the germans for her mother russia her beloved veronikatatyana samojlovamarries her conniving cousin markaleksandr shvorinin a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow through various trials and betrayals veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes holding hope that she will return to her powerful piece of film making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei urusevsky some of the many magnificently framed moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to borisand doesn t quite reach her even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes her lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of many examples where sergei urusevsky shows her genius at framing images that will last forever on film but without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly deeply love each other this film couldn t hold up with the beauty of the visual alone together however we re left with an amazing filmsimply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed her last breath i feel honored just have beheld such a great film	1
182	in my review just submitted i referred to the young actress lead as katerina when it should have been veronika i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i wasn t that concerned with names anyway she and the film are brilliant as i said the cinematography and the director s use of montage are worthy of eisenstein and her cameraman tisse  the production design is top notch the placement of actors in the foreground middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study stunning memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind gee heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow thanks again john hart	1
183	this film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema by seeing this filmwe can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgysuch a strong and adequate use of sound image montageand almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life cinema was then not only one form of arts it was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war it is said that even picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years audience that time was also different i read that after seeing kurosawa s ikirulive in its first release young couple quietly told each otherit is a good film isn t it i thinkcontemporary cinema though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective has lost the most important   reliance of audiencecienma was once really the most popular art from and unlike modern fine arts and contemporary musicgave millions of people hope and ideals in this point of viewletyat zhuravli must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time as city lightikiru and la strada	1
184	i watched this movie on tcm last night all excited expectation having last seen it twice in its memorable 1957 release in toronto i told my wife who hadn t seen it before to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot no cuts where veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her boris in a hand held frame that certainly predates the modern steadicam the shot then pulls back up and cranes pun unintended over the street as she exits the bus and darts among the tanks to cross the road then i remember that no cuts we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through anxiously looking for her but does not find her but we do continue to follow veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women all extras and each one a gem of riveting stanislavskian behavior how one wonders did kalatozov and her cameraman urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence but what did i see in this version after crossing the street dodging the tanks the scene abruptly ended and cut back to scenes at the apartment before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence seems to me that this film was not only restored but also re edited what a downer	1
185	if you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war you need to see letyat zhuravli called the cranes are flying in english it tells the story of veronika tatiana samoylova and boris aleksey batalov who are in love on the verge of wwii they are walking along the waterfront watching the cranes fly by when the war starts boris is promptly sent off to war veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son whom she does not love boris meanwhile continues trotting through the countryside fighting the nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war until she he runs out of energy when veronika   working in a military hospital   receives this news she refuses to accept it until boris  body arrives home on one of the trains simultaneously the radio announces that germany has surrendered and the allied powers have won the war the soviet union lost 27 million citizens but it s the start of a new era this movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield but also how it affected the civilian population this is definitely a movie that everyone should see	1
186	this is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film i saw it on tv as a little boy with my throat almost strangled with tears and again today on the magnificently restored criterion dvd cranes is the very essence of the war weepie imagine umbrellas of cherbourg with no music and no color or waterloo bridge with no class consciousness tatiana samoilova a cross between vivien leigh and bjork is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fianc√© enlists and doesn t write or come back the fianc√© boris dies on the front and her death scene is indescribably romantic very daring too because so close to over the top but that scene will stay with you although the soviets were so defined by wwii the movie is quite unspecific and more powerful for it the pre war and post war scenes have a very 1957 feel there is no attempt at period detail the whole film becomes more and more stylized until the siberian scenes which feel like a modern opera set that is a compliment the cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop   there again comparable to cherbourg the production feels like a big budget those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek go for it don t expect a bitter socialist pill although it is of course very sad the cranes are flying is an impressive slice of world cinema quite advanced considering where and when it was made	1
187	i m out of words to describe the beauty of the cranes are flying but i ll try anyway to write about it it s a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war it s the classic story of lovers boris & veronika separated by the war and of what comes between them the film s images are so gorgeous that you ll be carried away   the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion there are few scenes that portray directly the war a bombing   wind lightnings explosions   that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist veronika who waits for the return of boris and there s another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotional visual hurricane showing the images played in boris  mind another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title   the cranes flying in the sky this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film not to give up hope and fight for a better future kalatozov is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply it is not just pure technique  tatyana samojlova is perfect as veronika what more can i say the film transcends the time it was made   the action takes place during the second world war but it could have happened anytime anywhere as long there are wars great or small the film and its message will remain relevant	1
188	sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema i ve been making an effort to see the oscar winning foreign films that s when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girl waits for boy to return from war story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didn t become an international star after this is beyond methough she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work was this the pioneer in hand held camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when tatyana s character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film	1
189	this is a fantastic film the acting is some of the best i ve seen tatyana samojlova is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting the the cinematography was extremely ahead of its time watching it i could see parallels of cinematography used today this is truly a groundbreaking film because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes it s a very touching and powerful piece my friend told me it was must see and i definitely agree with her this is one of those films that you watch and never forget everyone should see this intensely moving film this should be put on everyone s movies to see before ________ whatever list	1
190	fabulous cinematography from sergei urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work the opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer s album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look all is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking difficult to describe without  spoiling  but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover s brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence soviet film making of the highest order	1
191	director mikhail kalatozov s film the cranes are flying letyat zhuravli is a glorious piece of cinema from the screenplay by viktor rozov based on her own play kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable however this russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way by telling us straight from a soldier s mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of wwii we have young men volunteering to wage war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don t believe in with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east and how people are dying for no reason against their will it s nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return communist russia shows how involved all were in the war while boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines her father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and her sister is helping her there as well as her girl veronika doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love an entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration even the factory that boris and her friend stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude whether this is all a glorified look into russia at the outset of wwii or not i don t know there are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks some in america could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday the acting is top notch throughout but some deserve singling out i really enjoyed antonina bogdanova in a small role as boris  grandmother she is the one family member she can trust and her sadness at her leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language vasili merkuryev as the patriarch fyodor ivanovich brings what is perhaps the best performance as spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments she puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding her son hard when she finds out about her volunteering just hours before she must leave but when boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man seated in sorrow at the table she loves her son dearly and although she may not be able to show it to her her actions throughout the film express it to the audience aleksey batalov is effective as boris a happy go lucky young man and idealist doing what she believes is right and aleksandr shvorin is good as the villainous mark staying home due to her talented piano skills or maybe just to steal her cousin s love that love played by tatyana samojlova really draws the audience in to her grief dejection and slim glimmer of hope the true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for boris  return besides the realism to the story as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across i also loved the visual style of the film sergei urusevsky s cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen it is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama it is completely different to do so in a square frame right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance there are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times sharp angles are utilized as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together the real feats however are those instances of the long shot used well towards the end to follow veronika through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for boris her own farewell needing to be said the planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through everyone needed to hit her mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema it s just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style the cranes are flying shows how successful placement and mise en sc√®ne can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do	1
192	mikhail kalatozov s the cranes are flying is a superb film winner of the golden palm at cannes film festival it has an excellent cinematography and performance by tatyana samojlova the only russian actor ever to win an award in cannes for a performance she plays veronika a teenager in love with her boyfriend happy and without preoccupations with plans of getting married her life will get upside down when world war ii strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army the film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight waiting for a letter or other information it is a portrayal of lost innocence samojlova does a magnificent job and her character transformation will break your heart the camera movement is fast with a lot of close ups it is a dancing camera the first scene in the stairs is fantastic but it isn t the only one there is later a scene when veronika attempts committing suicide and another in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history the bombing of veronika s house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire to find her apartment completely destroyed simply great 10 out of 10	1
193	like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure the image of the cranes that are crossing a muscovite sky they represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment in the beginning veronica and boris experience such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration it seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams but man is not a bird life draws up its own rules from which no human can escape and which we cannot change   not even by making a supreme effort war breaks out and without much hesitation boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil her patriotic duty she cannot even say good bye to veronica for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract boris  attention must inevitably fail boris eventually gets killed in war without veronica learning about it for the moment her brother mark a vigorous musician who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption is eager to take her place veronica initially resists but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to her charms a marriage takes place which is never accepted by the family soon feelings of guilt seize hold of veronica and she realizes that boris  return is the one and only thing she actually longs for she therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self sacrificing work in a field hospital when war finally is over once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers again veronica is among them forcing her way through a wall of bodies in her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of boris  death once again the cranes invade the sky drawing their wayward lines but now veronica is watching them on her own and the look in her eyes is a different one she has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans to follow the guidelines of your dreams for all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate 	1
194	it s not difficult after watching this film to see why post silent soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem don t get me wrong the cranes are flying is for the first half at least supremely entertaining boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin a fresh brisk spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms two stunning subjective set pieces and a romantic verve that flirts with but never quite topples into lelouch territory it s just that  in its subsuming of vast social national and world events to a love affair it is essentially no different from a conventional hollywood movie of course in a soviet union that emphasised the state above all else and in an era world war two that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief and the thematic similarities   all consuming love rent apart by war   with two of the most wonderful of all films seventh heaven les parapluies de cherbourg also adds to its potential loveability the story is simple enough boris a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family and veronika a student conduct a breezy relationship at night their only free time boris s cousin mark a composer also has eyes on veronika when the nazis invade russia boris secretly volunteers to the chagrin of her family and lover she promises to write to veronika but never does thinking maybe she hasn t bothered to see her off or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable veronika s parents die during an air raid and she moves in with boris s family helping out at the hospital where her father tends wounded soldiers distressed by boris s silence veronika is also assailed by the attentions of mark who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official she is eventually worn down and marries her to the disapproval of her adopted family boris meanwhile is killed in action veronika disgusted with herself and an adulterous mark refuses to believe this and awaits her return fostering a young orphan bearing her name the title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love symbolic perhaps of its transcendant epiphanical power but this is illusory   the cranes fly in a v formation and this shape pervades the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings interiors exteriors groupings of people composition camera angles the heroine s name   or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another  this serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies and also suggest the stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film although the pair seem to be free in space whether literally in an unpeopled environment or privileged in generous close ups they are always ironised minimised torn apart   by circumstances families by crowds see the brilliant if obvious sequences where veronika is engulfed by tanks or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd or simply by the film s structure which is constantly distancing through paralellism their closeness although at the beginning the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music what is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces the whole film but especially the war itself is strangely unreal and dreamlike we are never shown its harsh brutal actuality just its effects on the lovers in fact it is transformed into a majestic spectacle devoid of nasty germans  on the home front the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade or ruins of almost gothic decadence in the bunker the threat to the soviet empire is less important than boris s perceived indifference the empty oneiric moscow spaces the lovers initially than veronika with her mother walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces  when mark tries to force herself on veronika the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations this is a brilliant sequence filmed with silent expressionistic terror in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence all the more compelling for the earlier scenes  wistful gentleness it s not much different at the front either where fights over girls  honour are more urgent than tactics nazis or despair the movement of boris and her wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic and boris  final pre death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque from this point on the film becomes a little less interesting slightly more obvious one more grasp for expressionist overload   veronika s attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant   is clumsily handled and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film the use of deep focus at first ravishing soon becomes wearing devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning welles brought to its use in citizen kane after what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end when individual suffering as so often in russian art transmutes into symbolic ie sexless dehumanised hope a pity	1
195	unlike the many who have posted here i m not movie literate i stumbled across this movie by accident channel surfing and couldn t surf away this is a truly incredible movie worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it the actors are terrific tatiana is beautiful and innocent her fianc√© boris is sweet and patriotic you couldn t help but feel boris  father s exasperation and sorrow as she upbraids her son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war others have summarized the movie so well so i ll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most when boris  brother reveals to her family that she has broken trust with her brother and has to marry tatiana tatiana s twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape you fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on tatiana and the brother or worse show tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence since this isn t french existential cinema the latter doesn t happen thankfully  another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by boris returns to tell boris  father of the death of her son she unwittingly breaks the news to tatiana i can t describe the sorrow of this scene stilltatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that boris will yet come home the musician actually never saw boris buried after all i won t mention more scenes but do want to observe that the touches of soviet political correctness didn t detract at all from the film boris  brother is revealed as the piano playing anti soviet slacker that someone who steals her brother s wife to be would have to be no doubt she gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future you don t even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war with their own losses in mind first saw this movie incredible go see it	1
196	the aftermath of world war two almost resulted in the death of soviet cinema in the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature films were released in 1951} and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored by the government following the death of joseph stalin in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years it wasn t until 1957 that director mikhail kalatozov and writer viktor rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely considered the first post stalin soviet masterpiece  letyat zhuravli   the cranes are flying  one of the finest depictions of war i ve seen from any country or time period not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the soviet union but international recognition was soon to follow and kalatozov s film was honoured with the palm d or at the 1958 cannes film festival  the cranes are flying  is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious humanistic portrayal of war unlike many soviet war themed films of the time it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war time hero and more concerned with the futility brutality and indeed the inevitability of conflict love as a cinematic concept is too often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship and yet the reality is substantially less romantic in the film two lovers veronika tatyana samojlova and boris aleksey batalov separated by the advent of the wwii {widely known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war 1941 1945} pledge to marry after the war but tragedy denies the couple their wish driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting veronika agrees to wed boris  cousin mark aleksandr shvorin a handsome but unworthy youth the film may conclude with the proud victory of the soviets and a patriotic flag waving parade but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds perhaps the most remarkable feature of  the cranes are flying  is sergei urusevsky s inspired and dynamic hand held cinematography which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades {in fact only one of the film s sequences joins boris on the eastern front} but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind in one particularly impressive oft cited long shot the camera follows veronika as she frantically searches for boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families the hand held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus jostles through the crowd alongside her   capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands   before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode urusevsky first acquired her filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand held photography the camera she once declared can express what the actor is unable to portray her inner sensations the cameraman must act with the actors	1
197	this movie won a special award at cannes for its acting and it s not difficult to see why a few spoilers   but for the ending you ll have to watch the movie a simple story   in moscow on the eve of war between russia and germany in ww ii veronika tatiana samoilova is in love with boris aleksei batalov but they have a spat when she learns that she has enlisted in the army boris leaves for the front before veronika can tell her she loves her boris is shot but her ultimate fate remains unknown to veronika or her family mark boris  cousin rapes veronika who feels obligated to marry her degraded and demeaned by the cowardly mark veronika clings to the hope that someday boris will return superb camera work and wonderful set pieces by director kalatozov for anyone interested in film technique another movie by kalatozov i am cuba has at least two superb set pieces   one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of havana rises two stories to a cigar factory tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long long avenue   all without a cut superb acting particularly by samoilova and vasili merkuryev as boris  uncle that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement a devastatingly romantic movie with a heart stopping performance by samoilova this movie is frequently linked with the other russian classic ballad of a soldier	1
198	russian actress tatiana samoilova reminds me so much of the young audrey hepburn and the camera in the cranes are flying seems to love her just as much she is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of world war ii in moscow the film is almost poetic in its gorgeous b&w cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place since i had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on tcm it s a very moving love story about a girl s deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by her role as a soldier drafted in wartime russia she s unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to her but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced herself on her a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from their marriage is a troubled one because she can t let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart by the end of the story she accepts the idea that she s never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation there s a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families the stylish and striking camera work is what carries the film as well as the honestly played story tastefully done but perhaps the english subtitles didn t tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over summing up easy to see why it won awards at the cannes film festival reminded me in style of another great russian film ballad of a soldier	1
199	while watching this film recently i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957and in the ussr that makes it all the more remarkable many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 i first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the us and i was struck by its originality then now just having seen it 40 years later i have no reason to change my mind	1
200	i had long wanted to watch this romantic drama with a wwii setting and now that i have all i can say is that it s a veritable masterpiece of russian cinema  soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but thankfully this one s free of such emphasis   with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl doomed by the outbreak of war for which she gladly volunteers but from which she ll never return the girl a remarkable performance from tatyana samojlova is also loved by the young man s cousin and when she doesn t receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries her she however is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed her chances for success and knowing too that the girl s still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her finally word reaches the girl of her loved one s death but by the end of the film she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of her the film features some truly amazing camera work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and by frequently adopting tracking tilted and high or low angle shots renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama individual sequences are equally impressive   two in particular the stunning scene frenetically edited and sped up to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck and the young man s premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind i ve ever watched with the sun moving away from her symbolizing the life that s seeping out of her body as she imagines the wedding day she ll never have also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that s been hopelessly devastated during an air raid as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist   which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping her in the face   taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains disappointingly the r1 dvd of this outstanding film is a bare bones affair the ruscico edition features a few supplements but being an export tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot criterion released it in conjunction with another war themed russian classic ballad of a soldier 1959   which my pal at the local dvd rental outlet has told me is forthcoming  the only other film i ve watched from this director is the arctic epic the red tent 1969 albeit via the much shorter us release version a star studded international production based on true events given the unmistakable artistic quality of the cranes are flying i regret missing out now on her famous documentary i am cuba 1964 a number of times when i was in hollywood late last year apart from receiving a one week theatrical run it was shown more than once on tv accompanied by a feature length making of	1
201	a true masterpiece of the soviet cinematography it s a shame for the soviet union that samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the western movies    but then again she would probably never find herself there in letyat zhuravli she is unforgettable this was one of the few movies where i was crying in addition to samojlova batalov and merkurjev who are top rate it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all time classics world wide just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy german bombardment or the death of boris with a swirling sky above her head and her last visions appeared blurred in those skies the very simple means    but the great technique added to the emotional weight mind you 20 years before the star wars 41 years before titanic and with a soviet budget	1
202	in moscow the young couple veronika t samojlova and boris aleksey batalov are in deep love for each other with the world war ii boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before veronika s birthday and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other while waiting for news from boris veronika is raped by boris  cousin mark a shvorin and they marry each other however veronika does not forget boris and keeps waiting for her letyat zhuravli is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war the direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story inclusive in the capital scene when veronika is raped by mark the camera work is amazing with sophisticated planes and angles and long traveling the scenes of veronika in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many figurants are awesome the magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the dvd t samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance the speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti war movie my vote is nine title brazil quando voam as cegonhas when fly the stork	1
203	it does not surprise me that this short 91 minutes b w movie that was made 50 years ago in the soviet union during the short period called ottepel  or the thaw has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world it is sublime and beautifully filmed some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time sergei urusevsky s camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated the film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman it is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for it is about forgiveness and about hope the film received absolutely deservingly the grand prix at cannes film festival and tatiana samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at cannes for playing veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie after separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished she never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won t leave any viewer indifferent for me the movie is very personal and dear because i was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning i walked the same streets squares and bridges over the moskva river every family in the former soviet union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during wwii and my family is not exception my mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books cranes are flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply it is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life   my background my memory and my past	1
204	one of those films that i happened across through the criterion collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace that turned out to be a great decision i was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film the story it told and the way it was told the almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film this really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy	1
205	i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie if at one point or another you thought you ve seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie was made in 1957 in russia but the technique used here is probably something that we ve seen much later in the western worldabout 20 years later the level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot happiness  love war  despair joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similareven though i think movies like this are very hard to come by if you ve seen i am cuba  then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience the russian directors have something in common very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating artand yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together i am not a big fan of russia actually i hate everything that s communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe enjoy it 	1
206	the plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind the violent clash between adolf hitler s germany and soviet russia from 1941  45 with the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in russia up to the present day let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painful this very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of  letjat zhuravli s  beautiful shots its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption all beautifully tied together by a toy squirrel add to this the truly magnificent acting and it s easy to understand why this movie is so famous really one of the very best ever made  	1
207	love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the west and war was often more poignant should i say more realistic  this film is as much about war and love as it is about the soviet thaw of mr k s era it also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990 s with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of usd spent on special effects and marketed actors this movie is a classic of soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies  war 	1
208	if you re looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosterone pumped carnage craving war buffs out there don t bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii don t expect to see any nazis cannons blood gore etc it s not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war it s a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here you ll certainly appreciate it if you re russian like me but even if not you ll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version it s got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the english dubbing on this one i d say is just as good it s of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if you re studying film in any aspect	1
209	1956 was the 20th congress of the communist party and the soviet premier krushchev made a speech denouncing stalin and the stalinist purges and the gulag labor systems revealing information that was previously forbidden publicly revealing horrible new truths which opened the door for a new soviet cinema led by mikhail kalatozov once stalin s head of film production this film features a red army that is not victorious in fact they are encircled in a retreat mode with many people dying including the hero in a film set after 06 02 41 the german invasion of russia when germany introduced the barbarossa plan a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the slavs and very nearly succeeded actually getting within 20 miles of moscow in what was a red army wipe out a devastation of human losses 15 to 20 million russians died or 20% of the entire population historically this was a moment of great trauma and suffering a psychological shock to the russian people but the red army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious  during the war stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting introducing female heroines who were ultra patriotic and strong and idealistic suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic then russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy an obvious reference to stalin herself who was always portrayed in film as a bold wise and victorious leader but kalatozov changed this depiction as the cranes are flying was made after stalin s death causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation winning the cannes film festival palm d or as well as the best director and best actress tatyana samoilova reawakening the west to soviet cinema for the first time since eisenstein s ivan the terrible in the 40 s  this film featured brilliant breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work from her extraordinary cinematographer sergei uresevsky using spectacular crane and tracking shots images of wartime battlefields moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real another brilliant scene features the lead heroine veronica who hasn t heard from her lover boris in the 4 years at war so she is presumed dead but she continues to love her expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named boris who was about to be hit by a car another scene captures the death of boris on the battlefield who dies a senseless death and her thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees sky leaves all spinning in a kaleidoscope of her own thoughts and dreams including an imaginary wedding with veronica this film features the famous line you can dream when the war is over in the final sequence when the war is over the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets veronica learns boris died all are happy and excited with the soldier s return but veronica is in despair passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky  the film was released in 1957 in russia and according to some reviews the silence in the theater was profound the wall between art and living life had fallenand tears unlocked the doors    	1
210	the story told by the cranes are flying is not admittedly all that original young lovers are separated by war bad things happen to both we ve seen it many times before nonetheless we haven t seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union and reason to conclude that tarkovsky is not the last word in modern era soviet cinema i was reading chekhov s three sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film in act 2 masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding masha surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness to live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial   mere pointless nonsense likewise veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others  sufferings have been pointless better to assign a meaning to live as if one s life is significant and not to give in to despair it is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film btw as a minor correction to one other comment here  there may be a pattern of v s in the film though i hadn t noticed them myself but the first letter of veronika s name is not a further instance of this in the cyrillic alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an english b	1
211	having long disdained network television programming i remember the first time i caught an episode of police squad it was totally by accident it was during the show s initial network run on abc in early 1982 i am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared police squad s opening credit sequence on my tv screen i immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of m squad starring lee marvin one of my all time favorite cop shows i stopped surfing then of course came headquarters getting shot up followed by the immortal rex hamilton as abraham lincoln by now i was saying to myself what the heck is this then came special guest star georg stanford brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe i was hooked from that moment the episode was ring of fear a dangerous assignment with its comic references to on the waterfront and muhammed ali but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs leslie nielsen and alan north in their loose parody of lee marvin and paul newlan of m squad were an absolute riot finally i said to myself a network television program truly worth watching wouldn t you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later leave it to the networks    i should have known anyway i just bought the dvd collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago the naked gun movies were terrific as well but i really missed alan north she was so good as ed hocken peter lupus as nordberg what were they thinking casting oj in that part and especially william duell s johnny the shoeshine guy great stuff	1
212	nothing like this was seen on tv at that time and probably never will again from the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words police squad   in color you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom also to kill off a guest star and then never refer to her again where had you ever seen that before then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention you would miss several jokes in the background don t pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry this was the show that video recorders were made for way before married with children or the simpsons the stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a joke the characters frank drebin and ed hocken came right out of dragnet and they were absolutely straight no funny accents or expressions but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan only once as i can remember were there a segment played for silly laughs   a scene involving a trip to a dentist suction and a whole lot of saliva there were some tedious moments   like the informer johnny and an appearance by some celebrity that was strictly a one joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes oh well everything can t be perfect the important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter leslie nielsen was fortunate that this revived her career when they put the frank drebin character in 3 features but it must have been an achilles heel as well can you remember seeing her in anything except naked gun type work since and don t count the awful mr magoo reworked for live action she probably made a lot of money though	1
213	two years after the success of  airplane  jim abrahams and jerry & david zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great leslie nielsen as plain clothed detective  frank drebin  also in the cast was alan north as  captain ed hocken  ed williams as  ted olsen  and william duell as  johnny the shoe shine boy   police squad  featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still one of the best  freeze frame  sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to overflow guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included georg stanford brown being crushed by a falling safe despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim  squad  only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled this didn t mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the  naked gun  films	1
214	i remember watching police squad when it first came on abc in 1982 and i thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play in one episode there was a line where a man named once was shot twice  but unfortunately abc canceled the show after only six episodes i felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode one that i remember was in the opening where the episode s title was different from the one shown on the screen  leslie nielsen s portrayal of frank drebin was deadpan yet very funny and her role was in the narrative style of jack webb of dragnet alan north did well and peter lupus in one of her few roles since mission impossible wasn t bad as norberg but the one character that stood out was johnny the shoeshine boy played by william duell after giving advice to drebin there were cameos from dick clark dr joyce brothers and then dodger manager tommy lasorda  even though police squad had a short life on abc the zucker brothers didn t give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the naked gun movie franchise i ll close with a regular closing gag freeze the ending right here	1
215	a criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin offs naked gun 1 2 & 3 this is fast paced in your face rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses  leslie nielsen plays detective lieutenant sergeant frank drebin an incompetent detective who bumbles and fumbles her way through cases with the capable assistant of her boss capt ed hocken the story lines are spurious at best but it s deliberate as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters  the jokes themselves come in many forms be it wordplay slapstick puns or background gags most of them hitting the spot though some fall a little flat it s inevitable with this  gag every few seconds  approach that some will fail but the ratio is good  the characters are a delight from the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe shine who is some form of oracle the writing is witty and sharp as a cutlass  though not especially successful at the time it rapidly developed a cult following many blaming the shows  relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience chief amongst them none other than matt  the simpsons  groening and she should know  dated by todays standards if you can see through that aspect you re in for a treat	1
216	the inspiration for the naked gun movies casts leslie nielsen   who had only recently started doing comedy*   as the incompetent but heroic frank drebin always having to solve an absurd case like airplane and the movies based on the series the humor relies on mel brooks style spot gags and silly comments namely the yes it is remarks along with the fact that nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around her and of course the final frame in which something keeps moving it s too bad that the show only had six episodes at least it spawned the movies you can t go wrong with leslie nielsen in these sorts of roles i suspect that they all had fun filming it really funny *before airplane leslie nielsen had starred in movies like forbidden planet harlow and the poseidon adventure as late as 1987 she co starred in nuts alongside barbra streisand and richard dreyfuss but since the first naked gun movie it s been all comedy all the time	1
217	when i was young i was a big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently i watched the show police sqaud and i think its great leslie nielson s awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it s one goofy show one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits i think my favorite one is when norberg not oj walks in during the scene and she tries to fit in with the freeze frame classic the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes i know i think they used it too many times by whatever good acting good gags great show 7 10	1
218	i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams back in the early days at comedy central back in those days the 90 s their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k complete with bearded host capt frank drebin played by the stone faced dead pan filibuster leslie nielson is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think dragnet meets starsky & hutch the show boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios this is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz for now save it for later frank drebin is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable she is a master of the police investigative methodology aka   ask johnny the leathery old shoe shine boy this does not make her a bad cop cops get lucky also capt drebin notice she s a captain here has perfected it along with her partner nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote ables most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly the magic never came from the sight gagshowever at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background the movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series think of monty python s and now for something completely different if you liked airplane 1 & 2 naked gun 123 or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this  i always liked the series better than the movies even though i saw the movies first why 2 words  no oj	1
219	the creative team of jim abrahams david zucker and jerry zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in madison wisconsin i believe it was they had a group called  kentucky fried theatre or something similar they put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid as kentucky fried movie 1977 which was long irreverent sophomoric and really funny they followed up with the very popular airplane 1980 which really put them on the map in it they took some rather well known veteran actors in robert stack and especially leslie nielsen and putting them in prominent roles proceeded to parody every clich√© of every aviation film since the days of john wayne s batjacproduction of the high and the mighty 1954* pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with pramount television and the american broadcasting company tv network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless police crime drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years remembering the fine job that mr leslie nielsen had turned in on airplane she was cast in the lead as sgt lt captain frank drebbin the rank designation switch being one of their comic bitshe presided over a great series of successive puns sight gags non sequitors and overblown police crime clich√©sall of these strung together by someseemingly standard scripts added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info they always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and printed titles never matched they had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight dramathe musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into act i act ii epilogue etc were all part of obvious but affectionate ribbing of qm quinn martin productions they even had the same announcer as did the real qm s one thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter and boy they sure didn t need any phony tract the nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewer s close almost undivided attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind police squad s downfall in regards to the series cancellationan abc executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer so isn t that what one would want so after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodesoff to the afterlife of series cancellation went police squad only to be reborn in the naked gun trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses once again they did quite well at the box office oh well tv s loss is cinema s gain thanks to you mr idiot tv exec * the high and mighty was produced by the duke s own batjac productions and released by warner brothers it was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally mr wayne s family made arrangements to release it to television and to video	1
220	after reading over all these reviews i m very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 nbc cop show m squad starring lee marvin i read reviews comparing it to dragnet and some of the quinn martin police shows but if you watch m squad you ll see it was based on it in the late 1958 episodes of m squad onwards you ll see lee marvin who plays lieutenant detective frank ballinger get out of her car and then hes shot atand she shoots back the beginning of police squad is basically the same  including the jazz music and then lee marvin narrates what goes on im lieutenant detective frank ballingerm squada special department of the chicago police and in police squad leslie neilsen does the same im detective lieutenant frank drebin police squad a special division of the police department and so on in one of the m squad episodes there s even the johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a m squad episode entitled  more deadly there s a police squad episode entitled a substantial gift the broken promise which is the same story	1
221	police squad 1982 was a funny show that ended too soon but i guess it had it s run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many american television shows the geniuses behind this funny show were the team of zucker abrahams and zucker every since her straight act in the comedy hit airplane leslie nielsen has found a new career as a comedian in this short lived tv series she had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more the bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending but lt drebrin leslie nielsen got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed tooo bad they never released this on dvd if a show needed to be re released it would have to be this one a whole new generation is waiting to see this show highly recommended	1
222	the funniest show ever on tv albeit the humor is not for everyone i realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but it s a shame only six episodes were filmed the gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see drebin and her boss ed hocken pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal still moving would see everyone else motionless and try to escape in another episode the building started collapsing around them as drebin and hocken remained in freeze mode leslie nielsen was comedic brilliance as frank drebin and the perfect fit for this show ¬Ö how she managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time if you re like me you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them such as the rex hamilton as abraham lincoln tag line in the opening announcement somehow worked ¬Ö perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reason cleverly spoofing the old quinn martin detective cop shows of the 1970s police squad would return from commercial break with the words act two appearing on the screen which was immediately followed by yankees one or some other quip on the opening credits the episode s title would appear on the screen but the announcer would utter a completely different title my favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list but one of my favorites is when drebin asks a down on her luck boxer who has previously tanked fights do you think you can beat the champ the boxer responds i can take her blindfolded to which drebin responds back but what if she s not blindfolded a minute later in reference to the boxer s small dingy apartment drebin tells her i m going to help you get out of this sewer the next thing you see drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street in another episode drebin and hocken are questioning a bombing suspect s flimsy alibi drebin not believing her says alright let s say you did go the movies after a slight pause drebin hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say you did go the movies a few moments later when drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence she storms away and angrily yells tell that bomber to take off what s seen next is a cop giving the thumbs up signal to a wwii style plane on a runway right outside the building while there were many classic drebin quotes one particularly memorable one was sorry to bother you mrs twice we would have come earlier but your husband wasn t dead then another classic was i m a locksmith ¬Ö and i m a locksmith when a visibly shaken kidnap victim s father asks drebin what i do i do ¬Ö drebin in classic deadpan fashion responds back well as i understand it you re in the textile business as i said the humor is not for everyone ¬Ö many people simply will not get it during the show s brief run i remember the reaction being very mixed some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny for me police squad even 20+ years later is the funniest thing i ve ever seen on tv for younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen police squad because they were too young when the series initially aired i highly recommend i found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent naked gun movies	1
223	two years after  airplane  took off jim abrahams jerry and david zucker cast one of its stars   leslie nielsen   in this hilarious television series a glorious take off of old us detective shows such as  dragnet  nielsen played frank drebin america s answer to  inspector clouseau  it had the same style of humour as  airplane  clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as johnny the shoe shine boy who seems to know everything about everything guest stars  including william shatner  were killed off in the opening credits  police squad  was the first us sitcom since  batman  to lack a laugh track many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but i think it was about right the concept could never have sustained a full 24 episode run five years later  police squad  made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the  naked gun  trilogy was released jim jerry david and leslie had the last laugh	1
224	i still count police squad as the absolute funniest tv show of the 1980s somewhere on betamax no less i have all six episodes i knew that a show this good wouldn t last and that i had to preserve it for myself how stupid was abc they were quoted as saying that viewers didn t know that police squad was a comedy because it had no laugh track right when drebin has a line like you take chances just getting up in the morning driving to work or sticking your face in a fan how can that be comedy i ve seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new i missed before even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing don t miss it if you have chance to see an episode but if you re reading this then you probably already have copies squirreled away someplace as i do	1
225	i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation the all night wicker place club flamingo i don t think i ve ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight gags	1
226	the creative team that brought us police squad   and the naked gun derived from it   said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode basically the show was never given any chance typical hollywood the contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it most shows are presented on tv with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc the humor of the show is extremely dry it uses no laugh track and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery those familiar with the naked gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films in the films nielsen developed a particular take approach   that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected this doesn t happen in the show where nielsen s drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves   nothing is unexpected to her also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of mtv finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid in the first episode drebin to re enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles   ballistics the hard way this is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that it s perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation this sort of thing rarely happens in the films taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the naked gun films since they are both more compact more happens in a shorter time frame yet more leisurely paced there s not the rush for a punch line as sometimes happens in the films there are some inconsistencies that happen in the films primarily 2 and 3 that never occur in the show s shorter time frame of course there s no doubt that naked gun the first film is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema and if you watch the tv show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one s tolerance none the less it would be useful to have a dvd of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks   if laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for one s health	1
227	extremely funny more gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with a good ie funny nordberg not the fab only casted oj simpson in the movies when will these episodes emerge on dvd	1
228	to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all after all this show is made by the same crew responsible for airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies writing is superb even though the show is built on one liners they don t become overbearing or annoying leslie nielsen is flexing her comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying you ain t seen nothing yet the format was definitely polished to introduce naked gun when watching these movies notice how many schticks are taken from the tv show the brilliant part is that they don t have to be changed too much the show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later	1
229	one night i was listening to talk radio and they had leslie nielsen on the program she went on to explain why there were only 6 shows   with tv shows like mash you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didn t miss anything but with police squad you had to watch the show with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didn t see them who could forget  the part of town known as little italy with the coliseum in the background even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience leslie also said the one reason the show movies and other movies like airplane were funny is because they didn t attempt to tell what was funny it was up to the viewer to get the jokes well that s just my 2 cents	1
230	to be brief the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away but gene kelly rita hayworth and an impossibly young phil silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air a few of the songs are terrible clunkers poor john is a train wreck but most of them are great fun and the scene of hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for kelly s rival has to be seen to be believed another treat is the perfect faux nyc sets in the best hollywood tradition another attraction if you consider such things attractions is the howlingly awful male chivalry toward women the oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then in the movies at least is presented in its most lurid form here some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf one minor disappointment is eve arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything i can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and silvers  a missed opportunity	1
231	the most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances this typical rising star musical has an overworked plot even for 1944 but because of the actors it s still fun to watch hayworth isn t even that much of a dancer but she has a lot of  inexperienced  charm that fits her character kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role while silvers provides plenty of self deprecation and laughs the movie can also be very serious at times not a must see but recommended if you like the actors	1
232	although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the kern and gershwin musical numbers following her signature role in gilda hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well gene kelly who was on loan to columbia from mgm matches her in dancing and the sequence where she cavorts with her own shadow was nicely done the supporting characters were also competently acted personally i didn t enjoy cover girl as much as the musicals hayworth made with fred astaire however cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend my score 7 10	1
233	i m not a big fan of musicals but i was always enamored of ms hayworth s looks so i thought i d give it a try this may be the best showcase for the multi talented ms hayworth she s never looked lovelier in a film with the possible exception of  gilda  where she is sex symbol par excellence rita is more than ably assisted by gene kelly and phil silvers the comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing kelly does one of her tour de force dances dancing with the image of herself from a window but rita drives this whole movie an excellent cast featuring otto kruger and the always  wonderful wise cracking eve arden doesn t hurt rita sings rita dances all the while looking impossibly beautiful the music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever i find this movie works better than  gilda  which i regard as a flawed film to ms hayworth s credit she also drives  gilda  and gilda drives any red blooded male insane the film holds up well after all these years much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus	1
234	although i m not crazy about musicals cover girl is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of rita hayworth and gene kelly the film may be dated by today s standards and the story and songs may be nothing special but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there s a terrific cast to go with the film plus the film is a worthy introduction for fans of rita hayworthshe s simply breathtaking in glorious technicolor despite jerome kern s collaboration with the film her music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as her songs in swing time 1936 yet the songs serve the film well the dancing is nothing short of excellent especially coming from gene kelly s solo number and my favorite musical number alter ego dance the amusing phil silvers nearly steals the film as kelly s partner otto kruger eve arden and edward brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles and rita plays a sweet charming girl here a role that s a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like blood and sand 1941 all in all this is a delightful film that s worth watching even if you re not big on musicals yet the film s music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters irving berlin or cole porter wrote the songs for this film however it s the glorious technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film s production while i was watching rita hayworth do her stuff i don t think i ve ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since i saw moira shearer in michael powell s masterpiece the red shoes 1948 just watch rita in cover girl and fall in love with her	1
235	though i strongly feel that sitr is the best gene kelly movie but this a pretty good one i liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how gene got the girl my favorite part though without a doubt is gene s dance with her alter ego i love watching two gene kelly s for the price of one it shows what talent mr kelly really was it is a movie that i think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time so you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today i m sure that everyone out there has a gene kelly friend that has this movie in their collection so go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy	1
236	this was gene kelly s breakthrough and that alone makes it memorable throw in rita hayworth as her love interest and comedian phil silvers of all people as her sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser which is exactly how it turned out kelly plays danny mcguire a nightclub owner in brooklyn brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in  40s films whose star attraction and love interest is rusty parker rita hayworth rita is lovely and even plays a dual role as rusty and rusty s grandmother rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of john coudair otto kruger who romanced and lost rusty s grandmother the plot revolves around danny cutting rusty loose to the detriment of her club because she has a chance at success that she can t give her but naturally that s not what rusty ultimately wants because as usual in films of that time the right guy is the only thing on the girl s mind there are no surprises but everybody does their thing well kelly does the first of her amazing trick dances this time with herself as a reflection from a glass window she was the master at that sort of dance and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that she really does seem to be in two places at once the melodrama gets a bit thick and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two but kelly takes this film to the next level this was before she became a mega star and too smooth perhaps for her own good an underlying edge of rawness to her character lends it a believable and almost wistful air kelly s character in the 1980 xanadu also was named danny mcguire this film was the beginning that film the end of a terrific run for a dancing genius clearly this film meant a lot to her highly recommended	1
237	another great musical from hollywoods golden age i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from broadway and all its glitter although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform gene kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers rita hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she s given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine trouble begins for gene kelly as her girlfriend is now the talk of the town phil silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job of course there is the music and the dancing one dance performance by gene kelly stands out she is walking along the street at night alone and she see her reflection in a shop window her reflection soon starts dancing along with her in the streets great cinematography don t miss this one great entertainment	1
238	long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and cover girl is no exception to the rule a story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous the old adage applies here  that happiness and fame always don t mix the dance routines are marvelously choreographed what dancing and chemistry between rita hayworth and gene kelly otto kruger is the older gentleman who discovers hayworth when she sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left her at the aisle hayworth s grandmother maribel a jealous reaction by kelly drives rusty hayworth into the arms of broadway producer lee bowman the picture is basically history repeating itself at the end to add to the glory of this fine film there is the always wise cracking eve arden and the hilarious phil silvers appropriately named genius in the film	1
239	one of my favorites non mgm musicals it s a classic> rita hayworth is in top form her beauty leaps out of the screen gene kelly shows off her dancing skills and introduces to musicals her edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph phil silvers is the perfect second bananas and eve arden injects this movie with a lot of class  the structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why in this era where major broadway shows come from the movies cover girl hasn t been adapted to theatre	1
240	in brooklyn the nightclub dancer rusty parker rita hayworth has a simple but happy life dancing in the mcguire s owned by her boyfriend danny gene kelly rusty danny and genius phil silvers have a ritual on friday nights they order oysters in a bar trying to find a pearl the life of rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the vanity magazine she is invited to work in a huge theater in broadway whose owner proposes her she loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style missing the love of danny and her old friends  cover girl  is a delightful romantic comedy very naive and having magnificent parts such as the beauty and talented rita hayworth dancing singing and acting gene kelly specially in two scenes dancing with herself and with rusty and genius on the street the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars danny the character of gene kelly is almost nasty with her chauvinist behavior rita hayworth surprised me with her talent i found her amazing in  gilda  but she is stunning in  cover girl  in accordance with the information on the cover of the vhs  cover girl  was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot giving continuity to the story instead of just being  thrown  in the movie my sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent gene kelly festival and they loved  cover girl  therefore i dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations my vote is nine title brazil  modelos   models 	1
241	rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star unfortunately her career is getting no where in danny mcguire s night club when one of her fellow dancers says she s going to enter a cover girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters she reminds the publisher of her grandma who she was deeply in love with many years ago but when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about it i had never seen rita before this and i am so glad i did she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress there are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to one thing i didn t like was gene kelly s character she should have supported her girlfriend but anyway that s perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie cover girl is a glorious fluffy film   perfect escapism not everyone s ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to rita hayworth s star power great movie truly impressed	1
242	i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed rita s dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and let s face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she s also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever you ll have to watch the film to find out	1
243	a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth she owns a nightclub where she dances she s no star yet but she gets a big break when she s chosen as a cover girl for vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother when she sees the resemblance she picks her right away for a contest her maganzine is running hayworth s newfound fame at first works wonders for kelly s club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that her grasp on her begins to falter this isn t the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work it also helps that the screenplay is great kelly s not yet at her peak especially her peak as an actor her dancing however wow hayworth is the star but kelly claims the film s most memorable moment as she dances passionately with her own reflection it s obviously a take off of fred astaire s shadow dancing in swing time but i think kelly one ups it which is hardly believable in fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later the rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better too bad rita didn t sing her own songs well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting it s hard not to love her in anything she s really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era not plastic like many of them no you can really see the warmth in that woman her smile is so disarming phil silvers has the role as kelly s best friend and she is also very funny the trio of kelly hayworth silvers is obviously the kernel which became the kelly reynolds o connor trio in singin  in the rain eight years afterwards one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the good morning number in singin  i do think singin  in the rain is the better film as cover girl is a little rough around the edges this roughness though just adds to the charm there are aspects of this film that beat singin  in the rain and even an american in paris for instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers after all we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals there is no chasing around   an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to fray i really felt it 9 10	1
244	this has got to be one of the better post astaire musicals made by columbia produced by arthur schwartz and directed by vet charles vidor this picture really put gene kelly on the map and cemented rita hayworth s reputation as cinema s premier female dance partner she plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with gene and co star phil silvers but also puts her in the role of her grandmother a nightclub performer in the late 19th centry the music should also be singled out because this was i believe the last project that the legendary jerome kern most famous today for old man river and smoke gets in your eyes worked on and her lyricist was the equally legendary ira gershwin they supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization the music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it s so perfectly styled in the early 20th century idiom that was kern s original period it s a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time the story is pretty inconsequential which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s 40s golden age of broadway musical comedy style on film even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film s music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at america s enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlins probably the most memorable performance in the film is kelly s dance to the alter ego dance which found her arguing with and then dancing with herself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience this prefigures much of her later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself fans will want to seek this out for various reasons    kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see her outside of the confines of mgm with a different set of co stars and music superior to her usual mgm material hayworth fans will want to see rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability and fans of classic broadway musicals will definitely want to hear kern s final score and marvel at the quality of gershwin s lyrics and the compatibility of their styles this is a definite gem in the crown of columbia s musical program	1
245	rita hayworth is right there where she should be   as a cover girl in this 1944 technicolor film also starring gene kelly phil silvers eve arden lee bowman and otto kruger rita plays a beautiful showgirl rusty working at a small club owned by the man she loves danny kelly each friday they go out for oysters with genius silvers the club comedian they all hate oysters but they re looking for a pearl when they find one all three of them will have good luck they believe rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine   she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner kruger sees a resemblance between rusty and the girl she once loved who turns out to be rusty s grandmother once she becomes the cover girl the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on broadway come true danny wants her to have her success but at the same time realizes she s lost her cover girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by jerome kern with rita dubbed by martha mears rita is at her best playing both rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past for such a sexy desirable gorgeous woman she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men none of this ever showed on screen nor did the fact that she didn t want to be a movie star she is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life gene kelly is in a serious role here but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing phil silvers is very amiable and funny as the in house comic and best friend this is a very good movie with no dull spots the only problem i had is the idea that rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves when supermodel jinx falkenberg who plays herself in the film speaks of getting married she s warned by her boss not to that she s too necessary to the modeling business we re not told if rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at danny s   but all signs seemed to point toward the brooklyn club why couldn t she have had both nevertheless you can t beat cover girl for top entertainment beautiful color lovely music great energy fine performances and its most fabulous asset the glorious rita hayworth	1
246	this is one of the best musicals of the 1940s the glorious technicolor shows off rita hayworth s beauty and spectacular hair she should have made more movies in color but then columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for technicolor spectaculars rita is a wow as rusty parker   she more than keeps up with gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever she also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother the film opens with the show must go on   it looks great to me   but danny mcguire gene kelly is not impressed her motto is work work work one of the dancers maurine lesley brookes is determined to better herself and is going to audition for vanity s golden wedding cover girl competition rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well in a very funny scene maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing rusty gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges don t be shy and demure   chatter and sparkle rusty does so with gusto they decide on maurine and go to the show to see her but john coudair otto kruger sees rusty   she reminds her of someone from her past cornelia eve arden is still having nightmares over rusty s audition whose complaining features genius phil silvers and the dancers dressed up as working girls   rusty is a cabbie john is remembering a long lost love rusty s grandmother maribelle hicks the first time she saw her singing a sure thing   set at the races meanwhile danny rusty and genius are looking for pearls at their local diner they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s in my opinion   make way for tomorrow put me to the test is a spirited song and dance number featuring danny and rusty in the meantime rusty has been chosen cover girl and danny mcguires  is the place to be seen lee bowman appears as danny s romantic rival and puts a damper on things lee bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever   so danny never needs to worry rusty dubbed by martha mears sings long ago and far away and it is danced beautifully by danny and rusty the gowns that rita wears are stunning travis banton and gwen wakeling designed them danny wants the best for rusty but is afraid she will lose her gene kelly is also fantastic in the alter ego number where she dances with herself poor john is another look back to the turn of the century   it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations   hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit look for al norman in both poor john and a sure thing she was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals including king of jazz and paramount on parade she was easy to spot the cover girl dance is just wonderful rita was so talented   beautiful and a great dancer after a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of america s top magazines rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy cover girl song gosh i just love this movie highly recommended	1
247	this is a very enjoyable fluffy glamorous musical from the 40 s  cover girl  made rita hayworth formerly the dark haired latin senorita margarita cansino into a bona fide all american star it confirmed gene kelly s amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre rita hayworth is great as rusty parker  it is her picture and her presence is always at the forefront her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress  she plays every scene superbly here gene choreographed the dance sequences she was basically given almost complete creative freedom here and her  alter ego  dance number is amazing such artistry the stand out tunes are  make way for tomorrow   put me to the test  and of course  long ago and far away  the plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral it s about the perils of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed this will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laugh that said  cover girl  is not the greatest musical ever produced  it has a number of flaws that must be addressed one can say that a little bit of phil silvers goes a long way her character gets tedious rather quickly however i was impressed with her dancing ability and how she was able to keep up with gene and rita another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great the  cover girl  number looks fantastic but i m not a fan of the lyrics or the singing  poor tom  is a huge downer i think it s one of the worst numbers i ve heard in a 40 s 50 s musical yet it stinks the grandmother sub plot borders on being ridiculous but that s only my opinion others may like these elements still apart from it s faults it s a very very good film much better than most of the product churned out today the dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and it s mood is infectious 8 10	1
248	this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles vidor rita hayworth rusty parkercharlie chan in egypt sang and danced with gene kellydanny mcguire anchors away danny mcguire owned a night club in brooklyn ny and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in her club along with phil silversgeniusconey island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny rusty otto kruger john coudairduel in the sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be her top model jerome kern s music is heard through out the entire picture and the song long ago & far away is the theme music for this musical this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during ww ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their career s exploded on the silver screen for many many years great musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great classic film enjoy	1
249	rita hayworth as rusty parker is the cover girl du jour  she s one of the dancing girls in danny mcguire s club the most special one according to danny gene kelly and pretty much anyone who comes across her take for example vanity magazine magnate john coudair otto kruger enchanted by rusty s resemblance to her grandmother maribelle also played by hayworth in flashbacks whom she wooed devotedly when she fell in love with her she tries to relive her youth by fixing what she thinks went wrong between herself and maribelle she doesn t believe that danny could give rusty happiness or everything she should be entitled to  she even gets danny believing this herself when rusty shoots to fame as vanity s  cover girl  danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of noel wheaton lee bowman so what happens when danny returns to town with her sidekick genius phil silvers in tow only to discover that rusty is marrying wheaton as a musical cover girl benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by jerome kern and ira gershwin including the oscar nominated  long ago and far away  possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully sweetly sung as a duet by hayworth and kelly maribelle s number  sure thing  the more lacklustre  poor john  isn t a kern gershwin collaboration and  put me to the test  the dancing of course is top notch since gene kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography it shows in the simplest of dances for example her dance with hayworth to  put me to the test  or the joyfully exuberant  make way for tomorrow  number performed by the trio of danny rusty and genius which foreshadows the reaction gene s character has to the police cop in the title number in singin  in the rain kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the  alter ego  dance like its successors in anchors aweigh and an american in paris jerry the mouse and the 16 minute ballet respectively this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity kelly brought to the modern film musical wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn t be showcased on a stage and years before cgi kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match her in talent and style  herself the number is hardly five minutes long but it and kelly s genius still takes one s breath away even sixty years down the line this is the reason i watched cover girl and if nothing else this dance is truly worth it you can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto cover girl and rita hayworth  not that she doesn t deserve it witness the scene when rusty hits broadway  the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for rusty s entrance hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of kelly very few of kelly s co stars have that honour she is hilarious in some scenes for example her drunk scene when john and wheaton come to get her from joe s for some reason however her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help cover girl overcome its general curse of mediocrity that curse is only lifted whenever gene kelly is on the screen dancing or no or when eve arden as john s long suffering secretary  stonewall  sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation since the film in the end belongs to hayworth neither kelly nor arden can save it as a whole this isn t to say that the film is bad  it isn t it s enjoyable with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at but it s just not quite a classic the dancing is classic though  so watch cover girl for that and you won t regret it	1
250	cover girl is the best musical rita hayworth ever made ms hayworth will always be remembered for gilda however the next movie would be cover girl the story is great it is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business she does it without the help of her talented dancer director boyfriend gene kelly mr kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers the dances are spectacular it is fun to see phil silvers a comic do the musical numbers with ms hayworth and mr kelly  the supporting cast is perfect lee bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel the other boyfriend	1
251	a good story about rusty parker rita hayworth who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny gene kelly and genius phil silvers rusty is in love with danny all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl they never eat them the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing the movie has two questions that rusty must answer is fame all that it is cracked up to be and is less really more if you are happy answering those questions makes the movie the movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had never a dull moment	1
252	it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly s home studio mgm to realize her creative talent and give her some control over what she did in her own films cover girl also became rita hayworth s signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic of course kelly does a bit of hoofing herself there hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth s grandmother in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead susan hayward broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward but she s not interested in nostalgia she wants her for her ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film it s nicely done in follies style hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john when i say sing as everyone knows rita mouths words singing here is done by nan wynn the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september long ago and far away was nominated for best song but lost to swinging on a star what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number harry cohn decided to do what louis b mayer had refused at mgm to give kelly creative control of her own material kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things she ever attempted in her career in it she dances with a pale reflection of herself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate  in fact after one more loan out film christmas holiday at universal louis b mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time she was at mgm and she did get creative control from then on with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita s red hair and gene kelly s boundless creativity cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so	1
253	when i saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had mostly filled with robots i can relate to eledore s problems and i have a similarity to shiro and this is a great film to watch if you re a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me all in all watch it before it s out of print	1
254	i just re watched 08th ms gundam for the 2nd time it is so much better than gundam wing i can t wait to get the dvd and see what was edited out of the series this is great to see the gundams actually move about clumsily through the land somebody really thought over writing this move script see this today	1
255	the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict aina the zeon officer and shiro the federal forces  new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series and one movie the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation by far one of the best to hit american shores suit up	1
256	this gundam series only follows gundam 0083 stardust memory the story takes place during the same time line as the original gundam in the year uc 0079 the time of the one year war but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate the hero of the story is a young lt shiro amada who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort her life get complicated when she meets aina sahalin a jion ace pilot the enemy the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them the other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either every one in this story has a history to them there is also another ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots right up there with char aznable and anavel gato is norris packard not the top villain in this series but her presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight 3 of them against norris and her single ms 07b gouf custom mobile suit in conclusion this gundam along with stardust memory is a must see 	1
257	watched this film at a local festival the silver sprocket international film festival florida  what a lovely film a simple uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for her actions it neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change i wasn t embarrassed by any of the film content or language a real family film and the best british comedy film i ve seen since billy elliotthe film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of best film and best director ten out of ten	1
258	logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up plastic demon baby what this wasn t love life a little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great funny and original film especially liked the ending that didn t fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it nine out of ten	1
259	i watched love life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in florida it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn t derivative or exploitive a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting but as whole i think love life is a winner a ruby in the dust one for all the family a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn t littered with four letter words try and see it	1
260	wow why aren t more british movies like this great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances the comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great one to hunt down and watch look out for it ten out of ten	1
261	a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn t fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent nine out of ten for a truly lovely film	1
262	it s just one of those films you re either love it or hate it my girlfriend and me loved it told my brother to rent it and she hated it said it was too flashy and colloquial then again she only usually goes to see big action movies so probably not enough explosions left her disappointed there were some great new talent i d never heard of the leads before anyway des brady the directors brother was especially good playing a right dick at the start i thought she never would redeem herself but she managed to crawl out of the dark hole she had created and by the end i was really routing for her a very surprising film with a whole lot of heart if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original yashimo brixton in the uk	1
263	we really liked this movie it wasn t trying to be outrageous controversial clever or profound it was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy every other brit film maker seems to want to change the world nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style	1
264	rented this out from my local because it was the only new british film available this week never heard of the film maker before or her other films thank you imdb about time some one made a good young british comedy that didn t star hugh grant or forty something s the story is a morality tale but never preachy throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast luke goss s cameo was surprisingly very good but then she did surprise me with her excellent performance in  blade  loved the colour grading especially in the night club sequences great music and a truly original voice at work here nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge	1
265	a vg brit rom com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy quirky and often surprising this is not the best of brady s films kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest though it does have a unique charm well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high you know from the start how it s going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more	1
266	inherited this from my x s dvd collection when she left with my best friend enough said watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly nothing new there then and got a very pleasant surprise very british you no hardly any budget no faces you know or have even seen before the accents were a bit thick for my liking but after a worrying start a bit too close to home in my case it began to grow on me apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn t add anything i found the film throughly uplifting very real natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon highly recommended	1
267	after having seen the lost child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995 and having read the reader s comments mostly about jane tennison s background and helen mirren s superb role in it it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role robert glenister is playing as chris hughes even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser carrying the weight of her own pastwatching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of her actions i have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me helen mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her praise for robert glenister	1
268	i m surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this tv movieas far as i m aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer pundits and real people alike have praised it to a person anyway let me tell you right away that if like me you re a sucker for gritty police dramas you ll like the lost child tennison the heroine throughout the prime suspectseries has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard workobstinacy and sheer talent for police work she isessentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man hater unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and jeopardising her entire police job let alone future advancement or having an abortion   which she opts for this abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama   it s very skilfully dealt with in less than a couple of minutes screentime a marvel of economy in scripting and editing   but it s always there as a counterpoint to tennison s desperate efforts to find another lost child   a kidnap victim   before it s too late the story takes many twists and turnsbefore the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters although i found the many villains a little overdrawn the police and especially tennison herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series habitually inhabits mirren herself has said that she ll make no more movies in the series but excellent as she s always been in the role of tennison the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine  dick wolf s americanlaw & order   whoever appears therein each could go on forever as is my fervent hope	1
269	prime suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice detective superintendent jane tennison the first of three miniseries ps4 ps5 & ps6 with the notable absence of founding writer lynda la plante from the credits imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series the second three series pit tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age loneliness indiscretions a host of personal and professional problems and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal ps4 conjures two stories while ps5 & ps6 are single episodes each which find tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good in other words to prevail tennison must overcome both evil and good forces something which makes the always gray scenarios of the ps series yet grayer and the tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers very good stuff which only gets better from series to series b+	1
270	as the superb `prime suspect  series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement  prime suspect iv the lost child  has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen mirren easily dominates our eyes never leave her while she s on screen the search for the lost child of the title leads superintendent jane tennison s cid team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters the insight we are given into the workings of her mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini series but it may be too strong for many stomachs the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there s gripping tension during the climactic siege altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama	1
271	the third entry in the stepford franchise but apparently the three made for tv obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down whereas the 70 s original as well as the blockbuster remake with nicole kidman are commonly known and very popular i haven t seen either the early 80 s revenge of the stepford wives or the mid 90 s the stepford husbands but this the stepford children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film it s basically the exact same film as the original obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80 s to the nth degree the main difference here like the title implies is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective stepford treatment licensed by the local men s association for some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the stepford mystery until late in the film even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement the harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of new york to the small and peaceful community of stepford particularly father steven is excited about their new life because she already lived in stepford and always wanted to go back ever since her first wife whom her new wife laura and adolescent children mary and david know very little about died under mysterious circumstances the town is almost too perfect with picturesque neighbors and model students and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk particularly the members of the men s association and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress david meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school lois but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight david can convince her skeptical mother to investigate the sinister stanford secret the first hour of the stanford children is slow paced and rather tame but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the vhs cover promises and like a late 80 s thriller ought to be in fact the modus operandi behind the stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail and i think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that at least i did the overall plot still doesn t make a lot of sense and the script is chock full of irrational aspects but it s nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear the acting performances are far above average especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the men s association depict plausible characters and even teenage players tammy lauren and randall batinkoff give away impressive performances recommended without hesitation	1
272	the stepford children besides being a very good made for tv movie shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination it is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual i think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying i don t know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but i have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves i hope to one day see this movie on dvd i am at the starting gate waiting	1
273	you may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to the stepford wifes but this is an absolute classic much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining it only got a video release here in the uk but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy	1
274	the stepford children is the second best stepford movie in the stepford seriesi saw the original the stepford wives in the theater when it came out in 1975i was absolutely blown awayit was terrifici have seen all of the stepford movies and i like all of themi think that the stepford children is such a campy and fun moviei just watched it again recently on tape and i enjoyed it immenselythe cast in this movie was real good to watch barbara eden did a bang up job as usualevery role that she has ever played has been very goodbarbara eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of persondon murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this moviehe was particularly effective at being the irritated father to her two teenage childreni made sure that i have all of the stepford movie on tape to enjoyif you get a chance to see this movie you should	1
275	i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday since it originally played on usa networks does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again i don t think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version maybe they should also do a re make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller horror flicks well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information thanks taira tcampo23@aolcom	1
276	i was half dozing as i watched a late night selection of short films  but sat bolt upright from the first frames of i shout love and could not take my eyes away for its full brief perfect length with incredibly assured pacing and performances this film maintains its funny sad insightful tone throughout the credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type i had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work what a pleasing surprise to see the name of sarah polley a major actress who is too seldom seen kristen thomsen tessa and matthew ferguson bobby turn in rich touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up as they work through a reprise of tessa s favorite moments from their time together both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents  and to the director writer s skills the film creates a moving narrative with laugh out loud moments and caught breath sorrow i shout love is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films i ever expect to see it has wit heart and stunning originality it matters	1
277	so real and surreal all in one i remember feeling like tessa heck i remember being tessa this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending i especially liked the protesters tangent it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it if you get the chance to see this take it it is well worth the 30 minutes	1
278	this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we ve all been a relationship as it s about to end kristen thomson s performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasn t been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when she does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one   whether permanent or not   should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away	1
279	in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry great editing at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz but i guess it s acceptable at certain times two scenes which i must point out are the bath tub and the couch scene the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition throughout the short i viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality her mind spoke before her heart need i say more about the bath tub scene	1
280	at the beginning of this film which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn t know if i wanted to continue watchingalthough it didn t really seem to me that i had much of a choice so compelling was the situation gradually though that feeling of discomfort waned although it never really disappeared entirely and i felt drawn into tessa & bobby s predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together really just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now i love it even more i definitely recommend it if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it	1
281	excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair then again the point of the film to paraphrase another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate a truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch fixed and quiet for the duration bobby and tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise beyond that the  film within a film  idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat melancholic way	1
282	comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with mike myers   austin powers  and rowan atkinson s  johnny english  and more recently steve carell in the big screen version of the hit  60 s show  get smart  back in 1974 it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attach√© case full of documents marked  classified   the top secret life of edgar briggs  was her first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as  six dates with barker  the  doctor  series and  hark at barker  humphrey barclay had found her working in a pier theatre in bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include her alongside michael palin terry jones and eric idle in the children s comedy show  do not adjust your set   ttsloeb  cast jason as  edgar briggs  a well meaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service whereas john steed wore a bowler hat briggs had a trilby whereas napoleon solo carried a radio pen briggs owned a pipe objects fell to bits in her hands she read confidential documents in bed while her wife  barbara angell  perused woman s own  on one occasion it would be the other way round  when she tracked a pair of russian agents to a heliport she accidentally switched on the airport s tannoy system and broadcast her plans to capture them when she hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an sis man and her enemy contact it moved off with her aboard and took her straight to brighton when she tried to organise the defection of a female russian scientist she took a  short cut  to elude her pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park yet like  inspector clouseau  she always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of her colleagues as previously mentioned she was married her wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work she did though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at her from the window of their high rise flat secret service this secret service that you never stop thinking about the secret service she shouted back think of the neighbours they re not supposed to know i m in the secret service briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included  coronation street  villain mark eden  she was the psychotic alan bradley  as  spencer  michael stainton as  buxton  and  doctor at sea  s elisabeth counsell as the lovely  cathy strong  they answered to  the commander  played by the late noel coleman the commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving briggs temporarily in charge of the sis   which naturally horrified everyone this hilarious show was by richard laing and bernard mckenna who had written for the  doctor  series rather than spoof bond it was more of a send up of the serious spy shows such as  callan   though it had a bond style theme tune  furtive meetings in underground car parks code breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of her own stunts such as briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating her flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the  pink panther  films  briggs  had all the ingredients to be a smash hit unfortunately it was not networked in the london area it was put out on sundays at 725 pm where it was trounced in the ratings by the bbc s soapy drama  the brothers  it was then moved to fridays at 7 pm because itv wanted to showcase its latest american import   the tv version of  planet of the apes  briggs never found an audience a similar fate befell jason s next major show 1976 s  lucky feller  it was not until 1977 and  a sharp intake of breath  that she found her first successful solo vehicle you can see the title sequence  along with two brief excerpts in german  for this series on youtube unfortunately that is all you can see jason will not permit her early starring shows either to be repeated or released on dvd a great shame for the moment however edgar briggs  life will have to remain top secret coda i have seen a number of episodes recently and i m pleased to say it stands up incredibly well	1
283	in the  60 s  70 s david jason was renowned for her many supporting roles in television comedies such as  do not adjust your set   hark at barker  and the  doctor  series it was in 1974 that she landed her first leading role in london weekend television s  the top secret life of edgar briggs  written by richard laing & bernard mckenna edgar briggs is a secret agent of the  sis   secret intelligence service  she genuinely tries to do her job well but always seems to mess things up astonishingly enough though she always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the amazement of her colleagues   buxton  michael stainton  spencer  mark eden and  cathy  the lovely elisabeth counsell all of which answer to  the commander  noel coleman briggs is married to  jennifer  barbara angell a woman who much like michele dotrice s  betty  from  some mother s do  ave  em  has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare brained but well meaning husband no matter what like  some mother s do  ave  em  and  the baldy man   ttsloeb  was laced completely with slapstick each episode saw jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating her flat it was  custard pie in the face  stuff really  edgar briggs  was not a big hit due to poor scheduling from itv a shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast the leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show david jason vetoed repeat screenings of the show because she felt her acting in it was non refined granted the david jason who played  del boy   inspector frost  and  pop larkin  is way different to the one that played briggs but by no means was her acting unrefined most actors would have turned briggs into a ridiculous caricature but jason s performance made briggs a credible realistic figure odd perhaps but not unimaginable jason s next vehicle was  lucky feller  in which she played mummy s boy  shorty mempstead  it too failed to make the ratings her lucky break came in the shape of atv s  a sharp intake of breath  in which she played walking disaster area  peter barnes  for four series between 1977 1981 so while not outstanding as such  briggs  is an easy and worthwhile watch nice  james bond  style theme tune too	1
284	with the obvious exception of fools & horses this was in my opinion david jason s finest series coming straight after her tv debut on  do not adjust your set  these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days by comparison porridge open all hours and that awful series  lucky man  did not come close i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed her at her rawest shame on her a new generation deserves to enjoy this the series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against  the brothers  which aired on bbc at the same time before vcrs were commonplace btw i have only just noticed that her long suffering assistant spencer was played by mark eden  alan bradley off coronation street i am amazed she didn t try to murder edgar briggs	1
285	me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with her clever stunts that were pulled off so believably i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again she had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent she has in so many different directions she is an accomplished trip and fall guy and i remember watching a trailer once where she showed people how to do this professionally certainly she is the one to teach people this art she only showed glimpses of it in other programs she did pshaw this program shows how multi talented she is i am lost as to why david jason vetoed another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things she has ever done and i ve been a fan of her since she did this series it is said she did not like it because it showed the rawness of her early career well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when she took it but now her career has progressed so far i believe this would be a good time for her to do another series showing her looking back on her secret life full of blunders that she does not see rod	1
286	jacqueline hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is everyone out there will like it sandwiched between the amount of breast shots the times jacqueline rubs herself the various times jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the magdelena mountains this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples this one takes awhile to guzzle the performing is good other than great acting by dan the pizza delivery guy must see there are no standouts but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either and i do mean recent excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you d find in movies of the four skin related data fields or in the biological skimmer s found in any ibm shop in addition if you see a female in this movie the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene now that i think about it there is quite a bit of action in this movie between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked keeps em  speculating i loved it	1
287	anyone who critiques  jacqueline hyde  as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it s intended to be is just not playing with a full deck just from the title it s obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn t meant to be taken seriously it s as tongue in cheek as a nympho s french kiss and just as titillating the female cast members are all great and fun to watch check this out rolfe kanefsky is the clown prince of soft core horror unlike most soft core horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses the movie doesn t even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqu√© sight gags and erotic situations blythe metz the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier homicidal side of jacqueline is a real knockout watch and enjoy	1
288	one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew i could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved  i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart and i think this is one such work the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art  the critiques of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they didn t like the film going to this film hoping for a lot of t&a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn i think she graduated  in terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a tarentino film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the villianess heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings  i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride  gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just airhead bimbos so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of b movie land not disappointing	1
289	i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie but i was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny it s an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film there were moments that made my hairs stand up even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film you ll know which ones i m talking about there also are a few great special effects and the humor and the special effects aren t necessarily separate the acting on the whole is very good  way better than a typical low budget horror film the lead jackie in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man are well acted if they hadn t been the film wouldn t have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story this is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental	1
290	breathtaking at it s best intriguing at it s worst francis ford coppala s groundbreaking epic  apocalypse now  is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century and in my opinion the greatest ever film depiction centered around america s involvement in vietnam what i like most about  apocalypse now  is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre growing up as movie buff and with a particular interest in war films i ve seen many films which have attempted to portray the  images  and  feelings  of vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so films such as  hamburger hill  and  we were soldiers  fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of vietnam by depicting  heroic battles  which are more often than not tainted by the zeal of hollywood film production in  apocalypse now  there are no battles no heroes or villains there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of vietnam through the physical aspects of war rather it is a film which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute  horror  of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century the sheer brilliance of the acting in particular the interpretation of taciturn captain willard by martin sheen along with the spectacular cinematography filmed in the phillipines which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes  apocalypse now  an unforgettable epic evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation  apocalypse now  is not for the light hearted moviegoer it is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated	1
291	this is a classic war movie one of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans a star studded spectacle of immense power martin sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great marlon brando also along for the ride are robert duvall as an over the top di with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it dennis hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about her leader also in this amazing film you ll see up and coming stars such as laurence fishburne r lee ermey sam bottoms albert hall and keep an eye out for harrison ford too behind the lens is francis ford coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather films she highlights war in it s most basic form which for the most part is something you can t see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable the feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers honestly no films has ever made me feel like that criticism is hard to find the biggest qualm from some is that brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is unjustified it was money well earned a role that physically restricted her being at the time an unwell man and a role that she really made her own i can t picture anyone better for the role and if you get the apocalypse now redux version there s some extra bits of the great man and i think the redux does make the film miles better final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage if not then still you won t be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made	1
292	this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world the social criticism of our shallow commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell clich√© underscored by a mythical journey upriver to cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate with extreme prejudice a rogue colonel who s left behind the army s concepts of justice to create her own world when i saw apocalypse now in 1980 i thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece in particular i found the final segment of the journey with brando which encapsulates conrad s heart of darkness to be rather boring i finally got around to seeing apocalypse now redux and the flaws have been taken care of redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 films ever made brando s performance now seems full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound martin sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled it s great to spot a young harrison ford scott glenn etc in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as the work of robert duvall fred forrest lawrence fishburne and sam bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage if you ve never seen this film skip the original and head straight for redux i wish we could get a gangs of new york redux from scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece	1
293	i would like to submit the following goof during the bridge scene soldiers are seen wading out in the river asking to be taken away and seeking to escape some of the soldiers approach captain willard s boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone they have duffel bags packs and footlockers but not suitcases the use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping additionally if you look closely you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water this is probably a very good indication that it is emptyotherwise it would sink	1
294	it carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of vietnam and into the wild eyed look of martin sheen and dennis hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding colonel kurtzi don t say marlon brando because after watching the documentary hearts of darkness i am skeptical as to how much credit brando is due for that quality the tone of voice i m talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing everybody gets what she wants i wanted a mission and for my sins they gave me one they sent it up with room service it is indulgent without being narrow and alienating a good example of is hopper s indulgence into aphoristic madness generously installing lines written by ts eliot and rudyard kipling into her stony monologues i mean the man s a genius¬ósometimes she ll walk right by you without even saying a word and sometimes she ll grab you by the collar and say did you know that  if  is the middle word in  life ¬Öif you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs and then i mean she s a wise man she s a great man i should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas the first one s kipling the second one s eliot	1
295	you can find an anti war statement here without looking too hard that layer is hackneyed or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war stripped of judgement that layer is completely uninteresting or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of duvall s one liners but that s just a coating for commercial mastication you can try to view this as a  realistic  vietnam war film but ask any veteran and she ll swat down that notion    most vets will say it stinks or view it as a  will she or won t she  morality play    nothing rich there either where i found the value was in the superb self reference coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions the war to fit the greatness of the skilled multi dimensional actor playing  a great man  brando the man was as much of a maverick as the kurtz character the studios were uncomfortable with her acting  method  yet she always excelled and won accolades the  generals  are uncomfortable with kurtz s  unsound methods  in spite of her strategic genius so coppola makes a movie all about brando s greatness to hammer on the point she places herself in the movie as hopper a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras to spout her praises brando herself is only seen in half light and silhouettes    brilliant cinematography by storaro that only increases the actor s power and she goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation oh yes the horror  other pieces of interest the great use of point of view camera perspectives including  being in the firefight  long before private ryan the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip don t get caught in the outer layers the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self reference	1
296	i have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect and it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie i mean you just have to love robert duval  marlon brando  martin sheen and lauerence fishburne in this movie but specially duval i can not believe that kramer vs kramer did win an oscar in stead of this amazing war movie so this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie  the godfather  and the best of hollywood actors you can only succeed now i just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line this movie rules 	1
297	brilliant actors and brilliant picture i love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just so touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic the vietnam war was far from human and i believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances modern war movies are spending so much money on effects this is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination a movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate how insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion a must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this	1
298	this movie is a must see for any war movie buff one of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as kilgore if i say its safe to surf this beach captain then its safe to surf this beach kilgore smell that you smell that lance what kilgore napalm son nothing in the world smells like that kilgore i love the smell of napalm in the morning you know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours when it was all over i walked up we didn t find one of  em not one stinkin  dink body the smell you know that gasoline smell the whole hill smelled like victory someday this war s gonna end	1
299	it s that film that loads of people hail as a classic   apocalypse now now a re cut re up redux 22 years after it s original release the film is loosely based on conrad s heart of darkness it s main plot if it has one being capt willard s journey on a naval boat through the vietnam conflict on her way to terminate a rogue colonel colonel kurtz we see the characters and situations she meets and she tells the colonel s story along the way my initial feelings towards the film is that it s not particularly gripping at times especially early on but at least a good dose of comedy is put in in the form of surfing fanatic col kilgore as the film progresses however a good deal of tension is built up with willard s reading through various reports on col kurtz until the end is in sight when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end the usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional and i found the performances of martin sheen marlon brando robert duvall and frederic forrest to all be worthy of a special mention the score i found initially sounded out of place but as the film progressed i m not entirely sure if it did actually get better or it fitted better or if it had just grown on me but by the end of the film i was thoroughly enjoying it this is the second time i have seen the redux version i have seen the original around four times i ll say now that the first time i saw it i was disappointed i was expecting a classic film with lots of war the fact that willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn t carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that is the film seemed unnecessary this is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully as with all films that are more character than plot based as the second time around you know where the plot is going i had a similar experience with it s a wonderful life which is now one of my favourite films with the big four vietnam films apocalypse now wins over the rest on atmosphere but lacks the action and involvement of platoon the emotional intensity of the deer hunter and cannot really be compared to full metal jacket probably my favourite of the four apocalypse now is a great piece of work especially towards the end where it becomes staggering and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn t mind some casual violence	1
300	first of all i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrad s heart of darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie with that said i believe that this movie is astounding it is an excellent war film that doesn t so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it coppola showed real genius in the art of film making using many visuals to help tell the story the acting i felt was definitely all around up to par marlon brando s part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting her elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that you ve heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all in my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best made films of all time	1
301	francis ford coppola s masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open mindness and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had i am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter culture the increase of violence and death in the streets seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures coppola s film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war it is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary hearts of darkness a filmmaker s apocalypse a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture but dealing with it coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously the deer hunter and coming home or in latter ones as platoon and casualties of war before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in jacob s ladder or comedies as good morning vietnam among the more respectable coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of her life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war	1
302	i decided i need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film unlike other war films that focus on the event apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip the sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable yet you can t lay your eyes off of it based off of joseph conrad s heart of darkness apocalypse now slowly descends its protagonist willard martin sheen into madness most likely the same way kurtz plunged into insanity the production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for brando s unprepared performance she read her lines from cue cards there is a documentary titled apocalypse now a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film as the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees the song the end by the doors can be heard the next shot is of willard in her bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan we are informed that she does special missions for the military mostly assassinations when her next mission is given to her she is baffled charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the indy 500 the man she has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated herself along with tribes people kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and she must me stopped willard does not go alone however she is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles along the way they meet lieutenant colonel bill kilgore hoorah about the war willard ponders that if kilgore is that crazy what could kurtz be like there are many scenes that portray willards plunge into insanity the tiger attack the slaughter of innocent vietnamese the nonstop rain the piled dead bodies scattered about and the deaths of her crew members when she reaches the kurtz compound she is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist dennis hopper instead of assassinating kurtz right away willard begins talking with her and her conscience begins to doubt what she should do kurtz on the other hand wants to die she is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier willard kills her with a machete while in unison a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people once they realize their leader has been slain instead of killing willard they hail her as their new king willard rejects the offer and leaves them the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking the colors are grain free something that is rare in older movies i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery the acting ensemble is terrific with everyone playing their parts well many criticize brando for some reason but i think she nails her role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war the soundtrack and the score are haunting and provide the mood for the film i am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar like sound when the credits roll there have been many parodies of this film but my favorite quote comes from marge simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot your character provides comic relief for the show like um marlon brando in apocalypse now those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious	1
303	i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola s masterpiece i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981 as she waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert she was very humble about the praise i shared with her for this work of art especially her portrayal of the young captain this is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of american film history charlie don t surf robert duvall s famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and her pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks	1
304	even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the vietnam war jacob s ladder the deer hunter apocalypse now and taxi driver to an extent one feels that we don t even know the half of what happened even contemplating the horror feels inhuman and a progression   or retreat   to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of apocalypse now coppola s greatest and one of the most important films ever made loosely based on joseph conrad s 1902 classic heart of darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization   a surfacing of a bestial nature as it were a la lord of the flies   it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to vietnam the story is of willard a general commissioned on a special mission to cambodia after her first tour of duty in vietnam is served willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in saigon psychologically unable to go back home   eerily echoing nicky in the deer hunter so she is contacted her mission is to assassinate a renegade green beret who has isolated herself in a remote outpost on the nung river and who has purportedly gone completely insane   worshiped like a god by the natives and killing indiscriminately this man s name is colonel kurtz played by marlon brando in the second best role of her career the best being stanley kowalski in a streetcar named desire as willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying her witnessing the horrors and the insanity   and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all   leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with kurtz before they even meet by the time they do kurtz s methods don t really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly don t seem too unusual or out of place apocalypse   a place beyond morality the outpost on the end of the world the loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self kurtz s monologue about an atrocity she witnessed as a green beret and her later revelation is one of the most chilling and well delivered speeches in cinema history the film is about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point   here it s a lot like the deer hunter and just as good apocalypse however takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level   coppola s sweeping footage of the humid murky jungles of cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky   set to an oddly fitting doors soundtrack   as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with wagner blasting from speakers a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scenes ever   this all contributes to the sense of apocalypse   the end of the world   and not at some distant point in the future but apocalypse now and forever the deer hunter is much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness or to limp on this is why both films are equal   they are two parts of the same thing in heart of darkness kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality civilization and her inner savage in apocalypse now kurtz has left all conflict behind she is beyond good and evil she has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before her death kurtz indeed is only waiting for death quoting t s eliot in her temple to herself lost in the jungle her last words and the words echoed at the end of the movie are the horrorthe horror she is referring to the infinite void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black emptiness within her own mind where atrocities are born again it is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film   the experience in short that willard experiences on her journey the end part at the outpost almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in the deer hunter is one of the most deeply calmly and seductively disturbing things i ve ever seen	1
305	movies seem to fall into two categories films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs and those that challenge them this film is a 180 degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like the longest day and the green berets which seem more like disney fantasies by comparison the apocalypse now project the production and resulting film is heart of darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post modernist variety the cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve this is the plight of joseph conrad s original character kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in ts eliot s the hollow men mistah kurtz she dead of 1925 although neither a straight telling of conrad s heart of darkness 1901 nor a first hand account of the vietnam experience apocalypse now stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se like platoon and the deer hunter but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale apocalypse now is not so much seen as experienced the bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin captain benjamin willard martin sheen in a tour de force performance aboard a us military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of vietnam and cambodia where few westerners would ever tread her mission is to terminate colonel kurtz marlon brando a career army special forces division officer who was the darling of the us military until she went awol and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between vietnam laos and cambodia the official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out something else has happened to her that is far more terrifying than simply insanity sheen s mission is to terminate the colonel with the american public none the wiser the movie is rather episodic the journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as sheen and her crew meet different self contained aspects of the war at the ground level american audiences of the 1970 s had probably never seen this kind of film making before with the possible exception of the deer hunter which was released in the previous year the first and one of the most notable is an helicopter battalion led by col kilgore robert duvall in an oscar nominated performance who is a cross between general robert e lee and richard wagner she loves to play ride of the valkyries from wagner s the ring when she bombards helpless villages her line i love the smell of napalm in the morning is one of those oft quoted lines from the annals of cinema other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of hugh heffner and playboy bunnies despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing the original release not the later redux version does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between willard and kurtz the strange discourse between willard and kurtz is worth the price of admission alone and some of the shots of both sheen and brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film not even the likes of clive barker wes craven or david cronenberg have anything on coppola in terms of horrific imagery brando s kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within without giving too much away coppola s solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations according to the documentary hearts of darkness coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama and the atmosphere of the movie s darker hues would be compromised she wasn t sure how she could make it work until her wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom coppola was using as extras in the scenes with kurtz at her village after the viewing coppola had her ending and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of american film making love it or hate it no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene this film is not for all tastes just as conrad s original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes it s not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most american viewers to absorb it s the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban american life that make this film difficult for the average movie goer to handle which is as it should be coppola did not make a family picture however if the viewer can understand its larger point there is a lot to be gotten out of apocalypse now if you re looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre existing attitudes about american sensibility and heroism better stick with john wayne but if you re willing to be taken into places you ve never been even beyond the evils of war rhetoric apocalypse now will take you into a world you thought you d never visited before and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it	1
306	captain willard martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz marlon brando as she has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for capt willard to understand how col kurtz could go off the deep end as she has killing without clearance and taking the war into her own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through willard s long journey through the jungle to find her target she tries with some success to understand why but what will she decide to do once she finds her any movie that can start out with the doors  the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i can t think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the soliders  minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through it s use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here  an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just don t like fishburne ever since i found out she was cowboy curtis in peewee s playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary oldman on her brando is excellent as col kurtz and i can t think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with her questioning of her mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvall s lt colonel kilgore before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it s my favorite of her parts to date she simply nailed her character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung ho air cavalry commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of napalm in the morning the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn t take too much brainpower to figure out what s going on willard s mission is to kill kurtz plain and simple but it s the journey of the film that is really it s heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film s entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i don t feel they take away anything though it s just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in itin fact that s the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like kurtz  to go completely mad  a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what i ve said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam warso to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointlesseven if after having most recently view an i think it s a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it s been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made	1
307	spoilers this review has been edited due to word limit `the horror the horror  marlon brando apocalypse now 1979 and apocalypse now redux 2001 the sentence which is as famous as `here s looking at you kid  or `are you talkin  to me  or `may the force be with you  or `i ll be back  means a little more than some one liners when it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame what exactly does this line of dialogue mean the horror spoken of is the reality of war the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt when capt willard martin sheen stands before the dying col kurtz marlon brando at the end of the film `the horrorthe horror  is the realization of willard s corruptness she has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of her assignment this isn t a typical hollywood ending in most cases a character gains something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but willard both gains and loses she gains the knowledge that she has lost her morals and that is a shocking ending `apocalypse now  is francis ford coppola s tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film is wholly different from `the godfather  it is hallucinogenic visually dazzling and an ode to the guilty side of human nature at first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us at first it does appear to be another war film captain willard sheen is assigned by an army lieutenant a young harrison ford to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz brando who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as her slaves willard carries out her mission `with extreme prejudice  heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain chief albert hall chef frederic forest and a very young `larry  fishburne who later went on to appear as morpheus in `the matrix  apocalypse now is in a many ways a modern update of homer s odyssey as our main character willard carries on her journey she meets an array of original and strange characters including lt col kilgore robert duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer dennis hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in the million dollar hotel one of the worst films i have ever seen davies failed to make any connection with an audience hopper does she is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz she is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages in this case she is translating kurtz to willard although i m not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines apocalypse now has many kilgore descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner s ride of the valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history there is sharpness to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of playfulness when kilgore kneels down on that beach and says `i love the smell of napalm in the morningit smells like victory  we all crack a smile i won t lie to you `apocalypse now  is a strange film it isn t exactly the easiest thing to analyze the end may frustrate some viewers if they don t understand marlon brando s significant speeches but what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself kurtz says `you have a right to kill me but you have no right to judge me  brando s character kurtz is left to the audience to judge to many na√Øve viewers she may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to her head but that isn t what francis ford coppola is trying to get across by fighting in vietnam kurtz has realized just how great she had it and how bad some others had it by walking through devastated villages she eventually comes to realize that we are the na√Øve ones living our lives in a fool s paradise we are totally na√Øve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are kurtz realizes just how easily she could be struck by something just how easily she could end up like the people around her and she also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door many people think the horror is one thing it is two for kurtz the horror is the reality of how na√Øve she was and the reality of the war s impact upon men and after willard murders kurtz and hears kurtz s dying words she realizes it too she realizes the effects of war to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes her realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it has done to her the horror 5 5 stars   	1
308	well i ve watched this movie for over 25 years now and it s still almost as interesting as when i first saw it it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made i still think martin sheen got dissed big time in the billing too she dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film theatrical version how unfair is that sheen is fantastic in here especially her narration which runs throughout it s one of the best narrations if not the best i have ever heard in a movie her voice is just haunting as she relates her thoughts on this incredible nightmare like adventure i never fail to appreciate her work in this movie the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones i have never forgotten such as sheen losing it in her hotel room in the movie s first scene robert duvall and the totally out of place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with wagner s dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters the playboy bunny entertaining the troops frederic forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper greeting the crew in cambodia and then brando s bizarre character it goes on and on with strange scenes that s not to say i enjoyed everything no there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half can t watch that anymore an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by sheen s young stoned out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f words so there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure it is a film you will remember	1
309	from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out it has this freakish feel to it everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies what does push to such a high level is the  the directing was spectacular here francis ford coppola shows of her talent in her last epic movie unlike other directors she makes you feel as if you are in the war most others just display and show you the horrors of war coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared these feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story this is something that i have only experienced very few times while watching a film the writing was of course amazing too it brought you write into the middle of the movie it never made me bored and this movie is three hours the cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm the acting was bone chilling just look at marlon brando also giving her last great performance playing a deluded out of whack colonel when ever i think of a crazy gone made soldier i think marlon brando in apocalpyse now with brando n this film you don t want to look into her eyes like the movie she was freakish to me this performance is as memorable as the one she gave in the godfather martin sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of her career making you see everything through her eyes all the craziness she is experiencing and yet wanting her to get to her goal it is just a wonder why these two did not get oscar nominations robert duvall was able to show part of that craziness with her ludicrous battle strategies among those playing music to tell the enemy she is coming also duvall s character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable other great supporting performances were given by a young laurence fishburne sam bottoms and frederic forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√© also for once cameos were put into good use having dennis hopper and harrison ford who i both love i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie it has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best there is nothing more i could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending watch and you will see why it lives up to its title apocalpyse now	1
310	after the success of the first two  godfather  films in 1972 and 1974 respectively francis ford coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in vietnam which had concluded with the fall of saigon to the vietcong in 1975¬Ö the plot was loosely based on the book  heart of darkness  a story by joseph conrad about kurtz a trading company agent in the african jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the natives¬Öcoppola retains much of this including such details as the severed heads outside kurtz s headquarters and her final words the horror¬Ö the horror¬Ö  in the film sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities¬Ö on her journey up the river to the renegade s camp she experiences the demoralization of the us forces high on dope or drunk with power¬Ö  although as a result of cuts forced on coppola the film was accused of incoherence when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre¬Ö in 1980 the film won an oscar for best cinematography and best sound¬Ö  apocalypse now was re released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored¬Ö as a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is¬Ö	1
311	this movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke the film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers radios etc coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings that is a tricky and brave thing to do then she takes a superstar brando pays her a fortune and films her so that you can barely see her face the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully this movie belongs in the top ten	1
312	somewhere on imdb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times spielberg copolla and others are named there the greatest argument was around spielberg and whether she is or isn t a great director the problem with spielberg is that while she is a master technician most of her films lack depthsaving ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message is dull and while its very entertaining it doesn t make you think about anything an is the best movie i ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things starting from war in general the clash of civilizations the condition of soldier in wartimes is a soldier a hero or an assassin brando says she is neither the french lady says she is both  and many others the problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false but a great movie and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments not to solve them  maybe coppola is right or maybe she isn t nobody holds the truth anyway you can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scenes great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied but what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality you can t help but make a comparison with the recent fahrenheit documentaryboth copolla and moore tackle similar issues but while copolla presents matters from an outside  objective point of view moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary  it is really a shame that a film like fahrenheit 9 11 won a prestigious award like cannes but anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the vietnam war the iraq war the second world war and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one 	1
313	francis ford coppola s apocalypse now is not a vietnam war film do not confuse it with one it is set to the back drop of the war but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche it is also one of the most audacious films ever made produced or even conceived second to the lord of the rings trilogy to call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film s production levels opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the doors the end as martin sheen s captain benjamin l willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes willard s mission is to terminate with extreme prejudice colonel kurtz marlon brando who has invariably gone awol in the far reaches of the cambodian jungle and as told by her general is out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct and she is still in the field commanding troops kurtz is a delusional colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed her a god for willard this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat yet the journey she is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of her human behavior teaming up with a small crew they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat along the way willard educates herself on all things kurtz during sheen s raspy voice over she details her thoughts on the abundance of material she reads kurtz was a highly decorated and respected green beret she was a normal man with a family until a part of her succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and she led herself down the path that willard is being led the descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses but willard seems unfazed and desensitized in her quest to find kurtz as she reads about this mythic figure she is drawn to the man s power and why she has become what she has become we know that willard s slow decay will parallel that of kurtz s marlon brando has been revered for decades her presence unmatchable her genius undeniable but for those unacquainted with her acting prowess and unaccustomed to her physical nuance brando can be perceived in the eyes of an uncompromising film goer as a hack she is most certainly not brando was difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but her talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable the man obviously knew what she was doing even if we didn t her colonel kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity if the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than francis ford coppola s actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man s fanatical struggle to produce a movie it is reported that during the film s 200 plus day principle photography schedule coppola contemplated suicide the film was not only an undeniable struggle to make it is a grueling film to watch coppola s sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and her dedication filters through the orifices of martin sheen s haunted soldier willard i can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film at the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace audacity aside apocalypse now is pure film making my respect and admiration for mr coppola is of the highest order but i shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today s standards for film a lack of innovation it is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart but we still have the great ones like coppola s masterpiece a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend that depth in apocalypse now is the step into madness the killing can disturb the loss of innocence can unhinge but it is the damage from within the countless barrages of images that distress unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual the savage and the animalistic if the thought of killing does not provide sustenance the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis	1
314	i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie i ve never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just don t make movies like this anymore after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film hearts of darknessa filmmakers journey into madness i m even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so great the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film s greatest asset you actually feel like your in vietnam all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall i love the smell of napalm in the morning martin sheen and the great marlon brando a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well remeber what coppolla said about this movie this film is not about vietnam it is vietnam what she means is that this film is about madness and not the war this movie is based on the short story heart of darkness by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible way a true classic rating10	1
315	 apocalypse now redux  francis ford coppola s war opus is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen capt benjamin willard martin sheen is a vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to  terminate the position  of col kurtz marlon brando a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army setting up her own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers escorting her up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people most notably is robert duvall s kilgore a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose and some horrifying situations   apocalypse  is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study it is more  full metal jacket  than  platoon  the running time of  apocalypse  is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however after seeing this film i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history the  godfather  films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition with  apocalypse  there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen almost become a living character they are so pervasive and effective another gorgeous scene was when cpt willard and jay hicks frederic forrest were in the jungle looking for mangoes and come across a tiger the sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage leaves as big as a house made the characters almost lilliputian but the colorization of the scene was incredible while everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner this could have just been an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with duvall mentioning that she likes to play it while they are approaching to  scare the hell out of them   the performances in  apocalypse  are first class much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble she caused regardless of this she turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time sheen is completely outstanding   this is the first time i have seen her really unleash in a film ¬ñ and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony kilgore  apocalypse now  is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now most know several choice lines from the film  i love the smell of napalm in the morning  et al but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience i have not seen the original cut of  apocalypse now  so i cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 8 10   shelly	1
316	during the final throes of the vitnam war our central character capt willard martin sheen is dispatched by the cia on an illegal one man mission to assassinate a renegade us marine commander colonel kurtz marlon brando who has allegedly gone  completely insane  but who is successfully waging a private cross border war from her base in cambodia a neutral and therefore off limits country the entire narrated story of what willard sees and does as she is ferried up the da nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses decadence and ultimately the weakness of the anglo saxon psyche if we don t understand something and we are unable to control it exterminate it kurtz had eventually come to know this unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in kurtz s darkened lair you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie kurtz s subtle deal with her executioner her unilateral  surrender  in return for willard agreeing did she nod to tell kurtz s  son  another metaphor for us the next generation the ones watching the movie the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in vietnam is mind expanding stuffthe bonding between the two men whilst kurtz cross examines willard  interlaced with some of her own horror stories is incredible nay genius film the closing intercutscene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols coppolla has made intentionally or not the ultimate anti war statement one that should resonate through the ages	1
317	as i peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the imdb have posted on this film i find it very interesting how few middle of the road comments there are everyone either loves it or they hate it having seen apocalypse now approximately 30 times and having recently dissected it on dvd how did we ever live without those magical digital machines i can say without hesitation that i am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film why would you like a film that s so confusing ask many of my associates the answer is this forget the war forget the brutalitythis is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo brando represents the individual that has her own way of getting the job done they big brother sent her out to do the job she does it too well without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction am i the only one who s troubled by the fact that we have  standards  for death and destruction so they send the conformity police out to eliminate the individual hmmmmmmdraw any parallels between this and things you see every day with the deepest respect to mr coppola whom i believe is one of the best directors of all time i think she transcended her original intent of the movie and probably didn t even realize it until after the movie was released the subtle sub text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed instead it seems to have  grown  itself like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden again i must reiterate i think ff coppola did a bang up job on this entire production as did the cast and crew but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten fold so if you haven t seen the movie rent it watch it then watch it again and maybe a few more times and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life only then make a judgment on the quality of the film those of you that have seen it watch it again with the mindset previously described i think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film or maybe not no matter whether you love it or hate it be sure and give credit to coppola for her masterful story telling style	1
318	i first saw apocalypse now in 1985 when it was broadcast on british television for the first time  i was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of fellowship of the ring this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after i first saw it  this leads to the problem of how i can even begin to comment on the movie  i could praise the technical aspects especially the sound  editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised  rightly too  these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and robert duvall in particular have also been noted  and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the dou long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border  how about the script  francis ford coppola is best known as a director but she s everyway a genius as a screenwriter as she was as a director  i said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in her head  but her sacrifice was worth it  in john milius original solo draft we have a script that s just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen  but coppola s involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war  check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by bill kilgore who wouldn t have looked out of place in the green berets but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes  so much so that by the time reaches kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension  when coppola states  this movie isn t about vietnam   it is vietnam  she s right  what started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film s setting  the manson trial suggests it s 1970  had changed america s view of both the world and itself and of the world s view of america  it s the insane beauty of apocalypse now that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians  what did you do in the vietnam war mr president   than michael moore could hope to say in a lifetime  i ve not seen the redux version but watching the original print i didn t feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic  in fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who s leading an injun war party  or a sci fi movie where a un assassin is to eliminate a fellow un soldier who s leading a resistance movement on mars  though this is probably down to joseph conrad s original source novel my all time favourite movie and it s very fitting that i chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the imdb	1
319	my favourite movie of all time this was a flawed piece of work by coppola and seeing the documentary  heart of darkness  made it even more compelling coppola at this point was king of hollywood after making  the godfather  and  godfatherii  and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like  apocalypse now  through sheer arrogance she went to the phillipines with a partial script and thought she would know what she would do when she got there just as captain willard thought she would know what to do once she got to col kurtz s compound and just like willard she didn t know what she was going to do once she got there this is such a masterpiece of american cinema beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story what i like most about  apocalypse now  is that it offers no answers or conclusions consequently because of this open endedness it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious  this movie defies categorization some call it a war movie which it isn t at all really it is more of a personal study of man the best pic about vietnam is  platoon  in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the vietnam war go there first for answers  coppola should be commended for her take on the bureaucracy of war which she conveys quite effectively with the meeting with gencorman and lucas harrison ford and the playmate review the sheer audacity of kilgore makes her an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a hollywood classic it is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone very challenging to watch but rewarding as well i could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless this movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification a little footnote definitely if your a first time viewer of apocalypse now watch the original version first the  redux  version is i think more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a  new and improved  version of the movie	1
320	touching bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year old girl who finds out that she s adopted and is determined to find her birth mother the film s major success is the performance of ps keerthana who plays the girl the first half of the film is very good there are a few really good songs too especially the number that introduces the protagonist unfortunately the film s second half which takes place in war torn sri lanka feels like an entirely different and disappointing movie it s big on explosions and special effects with sri lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades running from fireballs and being yanked by stunt wires all the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like some day there must come peace and perhaps the children will find a way the final sequence where the daughter and mother are reunited is good but so over the top with the music and a well timed downpour that it feels like a cheat i know i know it s all in the style of bollywood but this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple powerful central story bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times too	1
321	recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by director mani ratnam at the 2002 toronto international film festival i have bestowed my highest honour of the film festival on this feature make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by  but be forewarded this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien a 10 	1
322	last night i saw a peck on the cheek kannathil muthamittal with english subtitles oddly it was 137 minutes long  slightly longer than the time listed on imdb at first i found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me the context for what was occurring was missing and i am glad i stuck with it at the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native sri lanka and the lovers are separated months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to india at a refugee center you see the lady about to give birth  after which the titles to the film finally are revealed the entire focus of the film then changes completely  to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in madras india you see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family none of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing  what about the lady who was about to give birth my wife and i debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2  though she did not realize these people were not her biological parents soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints i had about the film as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage and tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the adoptive mother was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest unfortunately sri lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with tamilese militants off and on for three decades the family s decision to look for the mom back in sri lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at times  as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war this was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents  first you tell her she isn t your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a war zone sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight if it were me i might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid  thus avoiding being in the middle of a war despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run also while i expected this because i have seen several indian films many westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where  this is standard in most films from india  including those made in bollywood bombay and tamilwood kollywood madras	1
323	it pays to watch reader s digest or time if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to mani ratnam to make this masterpiece based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents mr ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises where does one start the foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern sri lanka the chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer author and 3 adorably naughty children or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies whichever way one looks at it this film is worth being in your collection if you happen to like mani ratnam s compelling dramas mr ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film she oozes class in adapting two real life stories into one i will not go into the story as it is better seen than read but what i will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why for all the war mongering that happens in this world it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope innocence in its purity cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants it is an innocence of such nature that drives amudha to seek her biological parents despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that she is a more lethal entity in disguise amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well wishers  resistance and finally when the twain do meet mother and daughter the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears aided by a coruscating background score from a r rahman the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts a list of questions that amudha has to ask her biological mother in a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it a child discovers its mother alive in body but lost in spirit with the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her amudha does to her adoptive mother what this film s title means a peck on the cheek as for the cast the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant ps keerthana mr ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little known child artistes but this should take nothing away from keerthana for an award winning performance with an able supporting cast of madhavan thiru simran indira and the stupendous nandita das shyama she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in the music may be not as memorable as other rahman offerings but that still didn t stop her from garnering another national award for the best music direction vellai pookal is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature the dialogues are top class sample the touching exchange amudha and indira have on the swing shortly after the revelation that she is not indira s biological daughter and the cinematography superb this film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions do not judge it as a lesson in film making you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the mani ratnam a r rahman stable	1
324	mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with kannathil muthamittal such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion mani sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shootsin fact this was the only movie where she went outside india everthat too just to sri lankamani s class is written all over the movieand to add to it arr s musicwhich is just amazingvellai pookal is one of my most fav songs ever maddywho is what she is in the film industry has impressed a lot too starting from alaipayuthey to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru mani ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor maddy is simran has been really good too she has showed that she can act too in non glamorous and character roles in all an amazing movie sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box office	1
325	this film is absolute gold if you haven t seen it do mani ratnam outdoes herself once again this film introduced me to nandita das as well though everyone shines in this movie my only regret is i ve never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs we are led from the jungle of northern sri lanka to the serene beaches of southern india as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story the umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book lovely watch it	1
326	i have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching i liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true it s a shatter to that small kid and her search to find out who she is and before and after she knows about her the relationship between her and her foster mom that s a nice view a r rahman adds her stress by a good re recording and songs in this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices like in vuyire but simply narrates the characters as they are  and because of that the film exactly strikes the audience the pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for mani ratnam has amazingly improved	1
327	when you want to celebrate life and love especially for precious little daughters you have to shout it from the countryside and what gorgeous countrysides there are so many tears of joy even god joins in see this movie 	1
328	kannathil muthamittal is for sure a great movie i have to give it to mani ratnam for a great directing job and ar rahman for great songs the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black hawk down and saving private ryan i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work	1
329	hello all i went to this movie without any expectation though i knew maniratnam would ve given an excellent film i was stunned the backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in sri lanka and the government the story is about how an young girl amudha who lives with her foster parents at chennai india leaves to sri lanka in search of her real mother the high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse the cinematography editing and all other technical details full marks to the cast and crew i have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there excellent work though the war sequences reminded me of saving private ryan such a work was never attempted on indian screen overall the movie is great and hats off to mrmaniratnam mani ratnam has once again proved that she is a director who can take indian cinema to great heights i would love to watch this film again and again an excellent film and a must see	1
330	to tell you the truth i do not speak tamil and i did not understand the film my good tamil friend kaneswaran kumarswamypillai wow what a long name explained every thing to me what a great movie after watching this movie i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood tamil film industry the war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful the actress simran what a beauty give her an award for best looking someone ding ding ding come on i smell a oscar winner i didnt understand the songs but they were excellent mani ratnam is a great director and i hope her next film was a success	1
331	you don t have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a moviei don t know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to meunderstanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors and actressesemoted really welland the little girl was really cute she wasn t irritating like child actors in most hindi moviesthe story is really touching and hats off to mr ratnam for trying something differentthe relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realisticallyi could identify with the characters in the movieit was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn t hesitate to recommend it to my friendsalso the songs are just out of this worldthey were beautifully and meaningfully picturisedif only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics	1
332	i think this is one of the best tamil movies i ve seen in a while i love the fact that it doesn t revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics there are some great songs in this move ya ll especially  kannathil mutthamittal  and  velai pookal  great songs both of them i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting and superb songs  cheers simran	1
333	when i stepped into the theater i thought this was going to be a great movie and i was not disappointed one bit wow this movie is brilliant the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary great acting by madhavan and simran beautiful music by ar rahman this might most probably be the best tamil movie i ve seen in ages mani ratnam has yet again proved that she is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies this movie is basically about a young girl ps keerthana who is in search of her biological mother nandita das who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband jd chakravathy a young novelist madhavan finds out about this young girl s story and decides to write a story about her she and her wife simran decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother this movie really screams excellent the way mani ratnam presented the movie is magnificent  my rating   10 10	1
334	this is an incredible movie that begins slowly it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama then in the second half there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope if you are unaccustomed to films from india with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason stick with this movie especially beginning with the second half you will find this movie an amazing experience *********** minor spoiler here ************* i have but one complaint with the movie the dialog at the end between amudha and mds seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people s lives it was implied all along but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for mds	1
335	one more classic performance by maniratnam and her team they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic the war and its impacts in sri lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect madhavan no wonder she is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role she plays and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when she is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry music by ar rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times	1

337	i finally snagged a copy of kannathil muthamittal through netflix and spent new yera s eve watching an amazing drama unfold it began with shyama a winsome nandita das getting married to dhileepan in the backwaters of sri lanka and then a war takes over their romance shyama has to flee to india and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child several years later we see amudha a playful well loved child p s keerthana who is the darling or burden of teachers parents and fellow schoolmates alike in a very how to solve a problem like maria sequence on her birthday she is told by her parents thiru madhavan and indra simran that she is not their biological child she was adopted this tilts her confident love filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to sri lanka to try to find her birth mother the country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess but this also leads to their meeting the new shyama   one who finally is confronted by amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter the story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother the unconditional love of the adoptive parents the demons that drive the birth mother the normalcy of chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged sri lanka   mani ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring ar rahman s music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film the film has excellent performances from madhavan nandita das simran and an absolute stunner role as amudha   the abandoned one   done by the child artiste p s keerthana this performance won her a national award the cinematography is visual poetry   each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot i am intrigued by the connection mani ratnam has with terrorism love and obsessions i think her exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding mahadevan s character was quite unique   her passion and idealism did not make her selfish rather was well matched with how much she cared for the little girl her one liners were hilarious the mother played by simran was also quite multi dimensional   she was idealistic loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids the shock angst and obsession of the child amudha was outstandingly portrayed by p s keerthana her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking in fact the enigmatic characters were those of nandita das and her husband perhaps mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were   the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what she or she becomes it also kept her from being judgmental   this was another conflict in which she took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy kannathil muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama   i rarely weep in the movies but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick this is a beautiful film   a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film	1
338	the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen dil se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 hindi dvds in the course of four months i can say i understood the total attraction i was somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos it was an excellent movie i didn t know what to make of the dancing and the female vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow i found ar rahmen s score hypnotic i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan kuch kuch hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of ichi the killer a few other korean films  i can t be bothered to watch much else kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong horror and action science fiction films for the past 30 years but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal it is one of the mani ratman s latest efforts and i laughed cried got totally mad terrified and most of all i didn t feel manipulated the acting was superb the photography was beautiful i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting the music fit the movie perfectly and after the credits rolled i wanted to watch again so i did it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop this is what great film is all about i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over my wife is watching now and i can t wait for her reaction i can t expect it will be anything less than mine	1
339	this movie was astonishing how good it was the plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular at first i thought this wasn t going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that i was dead wrong i literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this i must ve watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week no the song scenes were not as awesome as they could ve been but the plot is what really gets you american or asain i would recommend this to anyone  and i have now i guarantee that after seeing this one you ll get the best out of it and its plot i hope you feel the same and write a rave review too	1
340	kannathil muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere this is the reason why this ranks as one of her best movies the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie there are some notable flaws here particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did another flaw is surprisingly enough the brilliant songs they again seem forced and stand out not gelling with the rest of the script having said these this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well ravi chandran s camera work is sheer poetry all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour especially in teh flashback scenes are entertaining a sincere 9	1
341	in sri lanka a country divided by religion and language the civil war between the pro sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte a separatist organization has claimed an estimated 68000 lives since 1983 human rights groups have said that as a result of the war more than one million people have been displaced homeless or living in camps the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in her 2002 film a peck on the cheek winner of several awards at the national film awards in india while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl s voyage of discovery the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9 year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka played with deep feeling and expressiveness by ps keerthana in a memorable performance amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama nandita das and dileepan jd chakravarthi were forced to flee when the fighting broke out leaving her in a red cross camp in a loving flashback we see amudha s adoptive parents father thiru madhavan a prominent tamil writer and mother indra simran a tv personality marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker skinned little girl young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday according to the parents  prior agreement while she is playing thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable distraught she questions who her father was what her mother s name was why she gave her up and so forth but few answers are forthcoming amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother now a fighter for the tamil separatists the family s immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions handled mostly with skill by ratnam though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood style film and that means tons of music and melodrama the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors however i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a r rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick high production techniques and fast paced music video style editing yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film s limitations tamil cinema has been criticized by many even within the country as being too clich√©d and commercial yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute	1
342	i am a big follower of indian movies especially malayalam and tamil shame on india for not sending this movie as their official oscar entry i have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up withby the way to all we westerners tamil cinema is more qualitative and very different from bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion coming to the point what was india thinking when they sent a movie like  devdas  to the oscars that was a really a masochist move i think they are trying to punish oscar judges with boredom by sending devdas since the judges toppled lagaan last year  devdas  is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of love fate and destiny i would keep away from it anyway not sending a movie like kanathil muthital shows how much of a revamp indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence now i know why this country has so many issues they are heavily talented but not showcased properly	1
343	sri lanka not a country i ve ever given much thought to i have to admit i didn t even know it was near india let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983 it seems that the rebels of the tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island mani ratman s latest film a peck on the cheek tells the story of a young girl named amudha who is separated from her sri lankan parents by the war and raised by a young indian couple amudha is a bright and mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child although her adopted parents love her as much as could be and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family mani ratman is probably best known for her 1998 film dil se which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story or is it the other way around a peck on the cheek inhabits similar territory but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers the central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family and especially that between a child and her adopted parents it s a pretty honest and open look at feelings that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others it s an emotionally complex film with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way the film revolves around 9 year old amudha played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress ps keerthana in her first and only acting role she s a princess and a monster always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long the young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her a peck on the cheek has such an innocent name i was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact i dare say the film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen mani ratman s direction is superb very confident and mature   the most sophisticated work i ve seen from this director yet the film is visually very stylish with some excellent camerawork and imagery ar rahman provides the film s soundtrack which is not as good as her classic dil se or bombay music based on first impressions at least but still shows her great musical talent i m not aware of a dvd release for the film yet   i saw it in tamil with english subtitles thanks to the san francisco international film festival of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight the production is a truly world class effort and i am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure recommended	1
344	i saw this film at the 2002 toronto international film festival this is the first indian film i ve seen in the tamil language and while it does share some similarities with other indian films wonderful music and choreography sweeping storyline the director attempts more than just to entertain the film tells the story of amudha a precocious nine year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from india to war torn sri lanka gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point though it is a simplistic one amudha is played by ps keerthana and she is one of the few child actors i ve seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying her charm and beauty held the film together	1
345	reanhauer bill roy is the leader of a desert dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of her people only to have a heart attack herself she ends up dying on an operating table and for the sake of revenge her spirit takes over the body of the title character jill jacobson who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon while i know enough about the directors  filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock nurse sherri is really not all that bad sure it s clear that this was very low budget stuff yet all that i found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects the acting is not as bad as one might expect either there are two different versions available of this on dvd a much more sex oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of t & a is the original cut with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments including one involving fellatio during a college lecture the movie would then be re cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly some scenes are dropped with new ones added with stevens the role played by jc wells expanded the movies  most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry and it works quite well this cut of the movie is more interesting overall i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them both versions hit their stride in the final third and benefit from a marvelously scene stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed reanhauer and a moody climax set in a graveyard although actually filmed in adamsons  backyard marilyn joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington prentiss moulden who s lost her eyes in a car accident and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with her knowledge of voodoo rituals the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry lubins  personal collection including compositions for such tv series as  one step beyond  and  the outer limits  nurse sherri known by more alternate titles including beyond the living and hospital of terror than any other adamson movie is actually fairly entertaining low budget fare i ended up having a good time watching it 7 10	1
346	  meet sherrifor an evening of pleasure and terror   cheap special effectscheesy linesyep its the original 1978 movie   nurse sherri   starting geoffrey land as peter desmondand jill jacobson as sherri martin and directed by al adamson the movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospitalthen she starts killing doctors one by onethe acting was okay but some of the acting was roboticthe storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more viewsthe directing was badand the special effects looked like a drawingthe effects didn t fool anybodythe death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn t make any sense like the sex scenesthe nuditythe football playerand many more overall its a good moviebut not the best 7 out of 10	1
347	i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in her long and varied career but the possession of nurse sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade z schlockfests like horror of the blood monsters and dracula vs frankenstein this film is actually scary am i saying that you re going to jump out of your seat when you watch nurse sherri no of course not but this pastiche of elements from the exorcist ruby and carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies you can t put your finger on what s so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere and what an ending don t worry i won t spoil it for you adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesn t matter whether nurse sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader bill roy who shines in her brief role geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend there are some blaxploitative elements here profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive in flicks after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing nurse sherri was a poverty row production and it shows at times sets special effects etc still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin s theme music for the late  50s early  60s television series one step beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie the early version features a lot of t&a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by sherman does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy by the way next to john carradine she s the best actor i ve ever seen in an al adamson film and she plays the cult leader like she means it	1
348	what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories you d think so by some of the reviews al adamson s films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they aren t necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits so you know things are looking promising this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital of course nurse sherri tends to her needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so her spirit invades her and nurse sherri begins to change no longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects there s a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of sherri s co workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo this is not bad if you re a cult film fan but it may be bad if you re a spiderman fan because you won t like it at times this actually lurches towards respectability for adamson anyway but then it unredeems itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy adamson s films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10	1

350	ever since 1981 nintendo has been making great video games such as super mario and zelda most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years games made by nintendo never seem to get boring because they re always adding something new it went from arcade games to the wii and i hear that there s a new version of the wii scheduled for release in 2011 the thing that makes wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons  and i have more good news super mario galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010	1
351	warning may contain spoilers let rosalina help mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day  120 stars will require luck and skill but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill blasting through stars show mario and luigi and what travelers they now are  walking upside down has never been more fun especially a final battle with koopa near the sun  this is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in nintendo s hall of fame	1
352	like some other people wrote i m a die hard mario fan and i loved this game  this game starts slightly boring but trust me it s worth it as soon as you start your hooked the levels are fun and exiting they will hook you  till your mind turns to mush i m not kidding this game is also orchestrated and is beautifully done  to keep this spoiler free i have to keep my mouth shut about details but please try this game it ll be worth it story 99 action 101 it s that good hardness 10 attention grabber 10 average 10	1
353	the mario series is back and in my opinion better than ever galaxy is the most creative mario yet even more so than super mario 64 the controls are great some of the best for the wii beautiful graphical design as well the levels are very big and the good old bosses are back there is tons to explore in this game definitely a high level of replay value i only have 2 complaints 1 the story is a little to similar to mario 64 and 2 the difficulty isn t very high though it does require some patience mario fans the game you ve been waiting for casual gamers this game is more than worth the buy 98 out of 10	1
354	*this comment will probably have spoilers i checked the spoilers box just in case but it might not have spoilers but be aware anyways if i say something that you might consider a spoiler and i don t* wowbest game since super mario 64 i got this game the first day it came out and before i got it i went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings yes they already reviewed it before it came out and i was shocked i was expecting something like sunshine because lately all the mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse but this one totally beat the other games the scores on this game even beat halo 3 it s simply amazing story not the best mario games are never known for their plots and this one isn t really much of a difference bowser once again kidnaps peach but this time invades the mushroom kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space graphics absolutely gorgeous the best graphics on wii so far the water effects are really nice too if you ever see the water it looks so real because the effects they put in it music simply amazing the music in this game is orchestrated not all of it but even the ones that aren t orchestrated still sound very nice gameplay very entertaining keeps you wanting to play more and more and for me since usually i tend to be very frustrated with games if i die a lot i mean i m definitely not the only one but this game for me didn t have that a lot now it still kind of did but not to the point like mario 64 where i totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad this one never did that difficulty there are two types of difficulty because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars which i think is kind of easy but to beat the game 100% you have to get 120 like always and that quest is way harder but at the same time still very fun length good length definitely not too short it took me around 15 16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars but 120 took me more like 45 50 hours now i didn t play it constantly that much i played first a lot one day then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day then the next two days i played it all day to me though i think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short so if you want a long game i suggest getting all of them presentation now the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb the way they are it just looks so much like something i would see in the theaters they are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any mario game so far overall this game is definitely a great game and i advise you to not wait until christmas get it as soon as possible this game also is a good mixture of old and new you ll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side or up and down because they ll change on gravity but even the music has some old classics in it so this game seems to be like a masterpiece to me it s my favorite mario game of all time but others may disagree but it s still a great game i recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this	1
355	i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting her to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peach s castle mario finds bowser and her son bowser jr attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma s home a floating space station here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader a woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station s power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure begins the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that we ve been waiting for on the wii a perfect 10 out of 10	1

357	i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment i watched this not expecting too much from it the fact is that the cast were superb especially the lead teen female the dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel she had gone through what they had as children what this movie is is a strong drama thriller yes i would agree they don t do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also i very good solid 7 out of 10 a little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from	1
358	one of chaplin s longest films up to that point burlesque on carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then prosper merimee s well known story about carmen i was a little confused about the difference between the imdb s listing of the 1915 burlesque on carmen and the 1916 version based on the running time i assume that it was the 1915 version that i saw since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer and from what i ve read those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes  from the very beginning it s clear that burlesque on carmen is one of chaplin s most complex and ambitious efforts to date starting off with a long back story told through inter titles about the tragic love story of carmen  carmen is sent by a band of gypsies a band who put the gyp in gypsy to seduce a spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation it s a clever chaplinesque band of criminals the leader of whom lillas pastia has spent 50 years learning to steal thinking she might be offered a job in politics  on a side note i ve seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of chaplin s earlier work but probably none quite as overt as in this one near the beginning of the movie as the band of gypsies are traveling there is a scene where the mules and women are loading and an inter title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears in case you couldn t tell i guess  chaplin plays the part of don jose the hapless officer who is to be seduced by carmen she is described as a brave soldier and lover of women not exactly a stretch for chaplin who removed any doubt about her ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant shoulder arms and of course she didn t have to act about being a lover of women what is different here of course is her polished military uniform and straight backed disciplinary manner interspersed of course with some of her traditional slap stick moves she strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority struggling to maintain the respect of her subordinates by exerting a gruff stolid exterior soon carmen enters loved by all men under the age of 96¬Ö and she immediately begins flirting with charlie i should mention that for a good majority of the movie it is surprisingly faithful to the original story which was full of jealousy and tragedy chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover able to evoke a jealous passion that i ve never seen from her there s at least one scene where she is genuinely a little scary  chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end and her boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn t very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on probably about five times longer than it was worth although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop i always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets the end of the film is it s strongest part it bears striking resemblance to romeo and juliet but just when you think that chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from her traditional style there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage chaplin as anything i ve ever seen nice work	1
359	being the second last of chaplin s essanay films carmen is a parody of cecil b demille s drama with the same title it stands as quite obvious that demille s acknowledged film didn t impress the comedy king that much which she later admitted in her autobiography parodies were not a new experiment for chaplin she had done several of them already namely her prehistoric past and her new job and would continue to do so until the very end of her career in films for instance in a king in new york chaplin does a very good portrayal of don jos√© and edna purviance s is very as good as carmen neither act as we are used to charlie is not the lovable tramp and edna is far from an innocent little woman but that was not chaplin s intentions either a burlesque on carmen is a somewhat odd chaplin film very different but includes good material nonetheless the main story is although very differently structured as in the original drama don jos√© is very much in love with carmen but is not alone in that field carmen carmen the beautiful carmen is loved by all men under 96 but she has the big advantage that she is an officer and there we are this is the famous story about rivalry love greed and honor seen from a humorous perspective thanks to chaplin s and purviance s performances and to the wonderful wonderful music by george bizet which i highly admire this could actually have been a near comedy masterpiece it s time taken into consideration it could have been but unfortunately although it is a good pretty good comedy i don t feel it s fair to blame people who claim that a burlesque of carmen is far from being a masterpiece but it s important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent but rather a result of conflicts concerning business when chaplin refused to re sign essanay contract after completing her last film for the company police they took revenge by editing back all the scenes chaplin originally had edited out from carmen thanks to this the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny and the film turned out to be rather a ben turpin feature   turpin played remendados   than a chaplin short naturally chaplin was in despair when she discovered what essanay had done and had to stay in bed for several days despite its obvious flaws a burlesque of carmen is highly recommended to chaplin fans and to admirers of beautiful music	1
360	i just re watched this thriller one i had previously believed to be one of hitch s lesser efforts how wrong can you be maybe because i m older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now i think it s amazing every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merry go round is just breath taking perfect in every way highly recommended	1
361	the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film historyalmost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastica psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murdersthat¬¥s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problemwhy dosen¬¥t guy haines go to the cop in the first place4 5	1

363	this movie was fabulous it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film the directing and camera shots are nearly flawlessaside from the dog scene when she licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion the plot is well written and realistic it was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that  i would rate bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character of course bates is first robert walker plays a very believable maniac she didnt overact the part which made it believablemuch the same how perkins didnt overact her part overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans   	1
364	this is another one of hitchcock s highest rated movies and rightfully so this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies one of them robert walker takes it seriously and this leads guy haines farley granger to trouble with the law another fast moving hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning not a movie to be missed  it is a shame that no one will re release this on dvd with loads of extras  just a cheap warner brothers dvd is all thats out there now	1
365	it s been said before  strangers on a train is hitchcock s best movie  and she s made so many good ones like other hitchcock strangers on a train requires your full attention to really appreciate it but once you canyou will	1
366	this is a well crafted piece from everyone s favorite master of suspense as usual the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding especially for the film s time i did not find the first part of the film very exciting but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another the only thing i did not like about this movie was the choice of farley granger for the part of guy haines somehow i didn t find her very believable on the other hand robert walker shines as sinister  bad guy  bruno anthony overall i would highly recommend this	1
367	rating 8 out of 10 directed by alfred hitchcock tennis star guy haines farley granger meets the mysterious bruno anthony robert walker on a train soon afterwards guy finds herself drawn into the psychotic realm of bruno s world  guy is separated from her wife and is now involved with a senator s daughter guy is interested in entering into politics after she retires from tennis bruno wants to kill her own father but doesn t want to do it herself bruno proposes that she disposes with guy s wife while guy s part of the deal is to eliminate bruno s father guy dismisses this idea since she isn t interested in having her troublesome wife killed  bruno goes ahead with her half of the proposal while guy becomes the prime suspect of her wife s murder as law enforcement continues to investigate guy bruno continues to torment guy wanting her to complete the other half of the proposal   strangers on a train  has one of the most exciting endings of all hitchcock movies	1
368	has aged really well   still thrilling and suspenseful today certainly one of hitch s best movies beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting her title as the master of suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5	1
369	i was lucky enough for this film to come on tcm so i had the opportunity to see it it s rather hard to find despite it being a hitchcock classic unfortunately it also has its shortcomings some of which hitchcock has repeated later first off the ending is a little too neat and perfect in the last few scenes until the last five minutes there is an astounding amount of tension then the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up very unsatisfying the ending is also overly dramatic for a hitchcock film she is was and always will be the master of suspense why would she stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending apart from the few shortcomings the film is great the plot is excellent one of the best and most universal ever the theme simple you meet a stranger a perfect stranger she offers to kill someone for you you know you have someone you wantif nothing else subconsciously dead the catch she asks you to do the same for her will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement you re clear of suspicion and so is she after all neither of you knew the victim and you don t know each other either you re just  strangers on a train  brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to the pacing is good you never lose interest or patience the cinematography is good but not nearly as good as it is in other better hitchcock films the acting is flawless the characters are well written credible and realistic hitchcock uses some of the same elements that she often uses the dominating mother the mothers boy etc the film is very good but it just feels a little watered down it didn t go that famous extra mile that would have made it great it stopped before crossing the line between what s common and what s daring that is the primary reason for the film failing to be great but mainly remains good with potential to be more than that the end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed however everything leading up to the end is very good so the film still gets a deserving 8 10 good but not great any fan of hitchcock should see it as it is among her best somewhat far down on the list but still there i recommend it to any fan of hitchcock 8 10	1
370	in my never ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable i tried hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the man s work lived up to the praise she had received i always felt she was good not great from what i ve seen this was the best of her films i ve seen thusfar robert walker is absolutely chilling her performance takes the film where hitchcock wanted it to go even an average performance here damages the overall product my favorite scene was her obsession about getting the lighter from the drain how exactly does she get her arm down there though bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by patricia hitchcock as barbara the rest of the morton family as well as guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the script lastly in any suspense movie you re going to live and die by your ending this one holds water unlike a couple other hitchcock films i ve seen i truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited	1
371	i knew the premise of this film and obviously i can t miss a good sounding film especially from master of suspense director sir alfred hitchcock basically tennis champ guy haines farley granger meets eccentric stranger bruno anthony robert walker on a train travelling from washington to new york bruno talks about a perfect murder guy hates her wife and bruno hates her father so bruno suggests swapping murders guy obviously didn t take her seriously until of course when guy s wife miriam joyce haines kasey rogers or laura elliott is found murdered in an amusement park guy of course is the chief suspect and bruno keeps bumping into her reminding her of their plan and giving her more things to help her kill the father she wants dead this murder enquiry and bruno s stalking are threatening her tennis career and her relationship with the daughter of sen morton north by northwest s leo g carroll anne ruth roman bruno realises that guy won t do her murder so she decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make her guilty guy s monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park after her tennis game guy and anne who obviously found out the murder plan race to the amusement park to stop bruno and they have a fight on the speeding out of control carousel also starring patricia hitchcock the director s daughter as barbara morton marion lorne as mrs anthony jonathan hale as mr anthony howard st john as police capt turley and john brown as prof collins and hitchcock s cameo is the man boarding train carrying a double bass some interesting dialogue and character interactions some good suspense moments and of course the unforgettable carousel finale a good classic film it was nominated the oscar for best cinematography sir alfred hitchcock was number 75 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons the film was number 32 on 100 years 100 thrills very good	1
372	as i looked at this movie once again i think it belongs among hitchcock s greatest films the first time i saw it i was just blown away by the suspense action and imagery it has the gripping ending the deranged murderer the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances some great on location shots eg the jefferson memorial in washington and penn central in new york it also has great supporting actors with hitch s daughter patricia in the role of the younger sister to ruth roman and the stalwart leo g carroll in another of her hitchcock movies the merry go round episode near the end is one of the most nerve wracking in hitchcock s body of work robert walker as bruno anthony her last full film gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train who worms herself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star guy haines farley granger granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce the movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train eventually they meet and the story takes over the stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continuesthe stranger becomes a stalker the action shifts from place to place including washington the fictional small town of metcalf the forest hills tennis championship and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions towards the end the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time the camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots when the closely fought contest is over the climactic chase takes place hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see penn station long since gone trains are featured in the 39 steps the lady vanishes shadow of a doubt spellbound north by northwest and this movie  this classic hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense   the 1950 s and i am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the hitchcock hall of fame	1
373	one of alfred hitchcock s three greatest films along with psycho and the 39 steps strangers on a train is as brilliantly out of control as a merry go round in metcalf and almost as deadly it s the kind of film you have so much fun watching you can t even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath top amateur tennis contender guy haines farley granger meets a singularly weird louche stranger named bruno anthony robert walker on a train thanks to the gossip pages bruno knows all about guy s problems with her no good wife miriam and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor bruno will kill miriam and guy will kill bruno s father who wants to put bruno in an institution guy laughs it off but bruno ain t kidding as guy finds out to her peril it s a great premise for a murder story and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film including anthony perkins in psycho while perkins makes her mark playing tetchily against the grain walker as anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park what drives bruno many commentators suggest her apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty guy yes bruno lights up the old gay dar but guy seems happy enough on love s rebound with socialite anne morton ruth roman bruno s interest for guy could just as easily be envy for someone making a mark in the world while she lives at home letting mommy file her nails oh i certainly admire people who do things bruno purrs looking like a cat eyeing a mouse you know it must be pretty exciting to be so important later on bruno calls herself a bum accurate enough except for our rooting interest in her even as she wrecks guy s life with her homicidal meddling it s the ultimate perverse underdog s tale there s a sense of integrity about bruno in her dogged dedication which commands our respect and which hitchcock plays to so brilliantly when bruno floats away from the scene of her big crime am i the only sick person in this world who s actually happy for her i think not yet hitchcock keeps the story on a right enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen we don t want bruno to win exactly but we enjoy her √©lan as she tries everything else is so perfect or at least close enough to make every shot memorable hitchcock always managed at least 2 3 good setpiece sequences per movie here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone 20 big shows the neon side at the entrance says and they aren t kidding script camera work a gripping tennis match ruth roman s jaw dropping figure it s all too much greatness for one film to contain even granger does her callow youth thing here with more risible plausibility than gregory peck ever managed you can call this a clinic in movie making but clinic sounds too dull strangers on a train is good nasty fun all the way through leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along heck i ll take that ride over again in a second	1
374	safer indeed hitchcock is cinema s all time pervert however we all know her perversions are ours as well so we forgive her and we not only forgive her but we applaud her clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride i saw hitch s 1953 i confess a week before this one and i put both in the same category as part of her trademarks these trademarks resided in her genius questioning and pulsing her artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame the pen is always mightier than the sword and hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with her wrist and then holding firmly with her hands she held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood most humans have otherwise comedy wouldn t be mostly a tragic thing and making people laugh wouldn t be so complex mixing all dark elements of high society with a wealthy psychopath bruno and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician guy the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by hitch inspiring many filmmakers not only with its plot but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares barely perfect	1
375	when alfred hitchcock made strangers on a train it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that she was back at the top of her form from 1946 to 1950 her films were not box office successes and her contractual arrangement with david o selznick ended because of this actually she made some really good films in the period such as notorious spellbound under capricorn rope and my opinion stagestruck but while notorious and spellbound were liked the audiences were turned off by hitch s attempts at experimentation her use of a dream sequence by salvator dali in spellbound was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists but the experiment with long takes in rope confused the public making ignore the merits of that film and the willingness of hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked   far more disliked then it deserved to be   in stagestruck a matter of bad timing for under capricorn it was released just as the scandal of it s star ingrid bergman and roberto rosallini broke out made it seem to be a failure which it wasn t the paradine case was another failure   and one that really had little in it s favor with strangers on a train hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested her in the recent films instead she concentrated on her favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity based on a novel by patricia highsmith the story was of how guy haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of her   bruno anthony a playboy   who is traveling on a cross country train at the same time as the athlete bruno is talkative and fawning and guy views her as one of the typical fans she has metif a little eccentric with her talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space but bruno knows all about guy s personal problems she is married to a promiscuous young woman named miriam and is in love with anne morton daughter of a senator bruno knows that miriam won t divorce her successful celebrity husband bruno mentions how she can sympathize   she hates her stepfather who is constantly criticizing her then bruno mentions sort of off the cuff an idea she has about two men   technically strangers   exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them guy listens to the idea   and agrees it is an interesting idea the train reaches guy s destination and her last comment is like a validation of the idea she just does not realize that the eccentric bruno is a sociopath and believes guy has just agreed to the two killing each other s foe it s a wonderfully simple plot actually bruno of course does kill miriam but she fully expects guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill her stepfather guy is horrified   and worse she finds that she is the police department s number one suspect when bruno to encourage guy mentions she has the latter s lighter she pocketed it on the train and can plant it at the murder site guy finds herself in deeper problems   how to avoid the police and how to control if possible the insane bruno hitch always planned the shots of her film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other there are constant cross contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other s orbits it is like fate drawing them together yet both have their own personality   and hitch with a typical twist makes the mad bruno actually more of an attractive figure her scheme may be vicious it will kill two people if successful and she will have guy live up to the agreement no matter what but she has a zest for life one suspects that once guy too had one but her marriage s failure coupled with her now dating a socially prominent woman has made her more circumspect and dull than she was the cast is good too robert walker probably had her finest role in this film only a year before her death it was a far cry from the homespun boy next door of since you went away or the clock her lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes as guy farley granger acts like a cousin of her co murderer in rope especially as the circumstances make her increasingly suspicious to the authorities as her earlier role made her jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to jimmy stewart as for the ladies kasie rogers is properly sluttish as miriam   enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses so that they actually are cheering bruno in her act of evil patricia hitchcock appears as the younger sister of anne ruth roman who bears a close resemblance to miriam and accidentally sets off bruno at a social occasion she plays this rare role well ruth roman is properly supportive of granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed other supporting performers leo g caroll as the senator marion lorne usually a comedian as bruno s dotty mother and norma varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from walker are all shown to best advantage   all at the hand of a master	1
376	i have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen dvd as opposed to old vhs tape from rental store saucey for it s time and i m sure the hayes code was pushed to it s limits hitch s pallet here is the game play between two combatants and yes if guy calls the cops on bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter hello people do you always make the best or most logical choice how many times have you been in either person s shoes and made the right choice for the love of god it s called poetic licensehowever as guy sees the situation she has found herself in she takes it upon herself to rectify it she does not solicit help nor does she lie to her would be new wife her defense of her sets off the final show down with bruno feeling she has one more card to play for the cop shot ting an innocent person in pre cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen in the post rodney king world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man if you haven t seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academeny back to the movie go watch it with try and wear a post wwii filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure it s been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed	1
377	in alfred hitchcock s adaptation of patricia highsmith s strangers on a train guy haines farley grangerand bruno anthony robert walkermeet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders the rather pushy anthony suggests that she could murder haines  unfaithful wife and haines could murder anthony s domineering father the lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved the tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious complications arise later when anthony murders haines  wife in an amusement park and then pursues haines to keep her side of the bargain the differences between the two men are clear from the start haines is a professional tennis player respectable and rather modest about her achievements whereas anthony s life is going nowhere and she admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling haines is in a relationship with a senator s daughter who she wants to marry anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on haines  part to provide herself with a shortcut to a career the character differences are also reinforced visually anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called pluto whereas haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles there are some striking visual sequences such as   1 the murder of haines  wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from anthony 2 the depiction of anthony alone dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white jefferson memorial building 3 the occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison following the action whilst one head anthony s chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at haines 4the scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story for example haines and anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train as the train pulls out of the station there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward the 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies the hitchcock cameo sees her struggling on board the train carrying a double bass haines feels double crossed when her wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce haines  wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends when anthony confronts her before the murder she lights her cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses anthony later becomes very disconcerted when she meets the senator s younger daughter who she sees as a double for haines  wife anthony also feels double crossed when haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder when haines is travelling alone in a train going to metcalf she sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that she and anthony had the action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of robert walker and patricia hitchcock as the senator s younger daughter are particularly powerful	1
378	in truffaut book length interview with hitchcock it s apparent that big al s fear from the police dates back to her childhood her father sent her to the police station carrying a note the note said she s been naughty imprison her for an hour the policemen obliged and ever since hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police strangers on a train is probably one of the best in her wrongly accused series the movie is based on a patricia highsmith novel that s the same author who wrote the ripley series she was always fascinated by smart criminals hitchcock s opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists guy haines a famous tennis player and bruno anthony the aspiring criminal the two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew bruno tries to persuade guy that they could commit the perfect murder leaving no clues if they switch victims bruno will kill guy s wife who wouldn t give her a divorce and guy would kill bruno s father the motives are respectively love and money bruno s performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic this is not something that was done by accident in fact hitchcock edited two versions of the movie one us one uk in the us version the volume of bruno s seductiveness was turned down quite a bit strangers on a train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent hitchcock thriller an excellent example of a thrilling scene is when guy is climbing the steps up to bruno s father room hitchcock reasoned that the audience s attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they don t figure out what guy will find in the room hitch treats us to a huge menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction the most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match bruno has been continuously stalking guy so that guy will fulfil her end of the bargain kill her father when guy looks at the audience all the heads are swiveling back and forth all except one   bruno s she s looking straight at guy with an i ll get you smile the ending is another example of suspense both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry go round that s rotating at mad speed a worker is crawling under it so she could get to the controls when we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with guy proving her innocence we are left exhausted and nail less for those of us still biting our nails strangers on a train is easily one of hitchcock s best wrongly accused movies some credit her with one of the best villains bruno as well all in all the movie might appear somewhat dated but that s a lesson in thriller making from the master herself i won t turn down leonardo if she came to teach me renaissance painting so neither should you << review posted at filmdailiescom>>	1
379	this is one of alfred hitchcock s best films and one of her most underrated i believe it certainly exceeds a  psycho  or  the birds  for technical artistry and brilliance it is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time robert walker creates one of hitchcock s most memorable villains as the father hating mother fixated but aren t most of hitchcock s villains mummy s boys bruno it is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film her character is obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how she is described as  european  strangely charming and dangerous to cross farley granger certainly knows this as she becomes entangled in bruno s sordid web after the pair meet on a train bruno knowing some inside information on guy s affairs proposes the two  swap  murders for each other s benefit walker will kill granger s slutty conniving wife who is inhibiting her marriage to beautiful anne whilst granger will murder bruno s father who she so intensely hates everyone s happy right a win win as bruno asserts wrong granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed walker doesn t she commits her murder and is determined to hound granger until she completes her side of the bargain too  strangers  becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat and mouse in hitch s capable hands hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes we have the whore miriam granger s estranged wife pregnant to another man she lasciviously slurps a phallic ice cream cone whilst openly eating up bruno with her eyes barbara morton anne s sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you ll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50 s senator morton is authoritative and self absorbed this is one of the most daring films hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a hitch film subtly sexual in detail this fits into the film noir category with it s focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography walker s nut is one for the ages and granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and i never believed her relationship with granger still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the best american films ever made just look at what hitch does here  the originality the technical skill we see the murder of miriam reflected in her shattered glasses a game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes you ll ever see a innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences a young boy s balloon is popped callously by walker hitch obviously liked what she saw in  the third man children s delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fast paced terror hitch subverts normal everyday events like no other the camera work here is among the best ever seen in a hitchcock film and the premise is to die for it s slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm the cross cutting between walker and granger s characters is magnificent  granger s do or die tennis match is just as vital as villain walker s rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain hitch again build her villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming did anyone else find her strangely attractive more so than granger piece of work  we are just as tense as walker in our hope that she can get the lighter out of the drain we need her to anyway she holds the key to the story you ll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film amazing 10 10	1
380	well this is about as good as they come there are arguments about whether hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician    or was she really deep nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but it s legitimate to ask if at her best she could not have been all three things at once in this one she seems to be about at her peak hardly anything in it is accidental it abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit and the story is engrossing patricia highsmith apparently having complexes similar to hitchcock s own i m sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so i won t bother going into it i ll just point out five on screen incidents that hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for bruno antony walker has followed miriam laura miller and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her she s noticed her attention and is innocently flattered by it 1 laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the tunnel of love and then to an island in the center of the lake walker is right behind them smiling in her boat    pluto pluto it s not an allusion to the walt disney cartoon character it s a reference to pluto also called hades a god of the underworld in greek and roman mythology this tiny touch can t be an accident and the underworld that walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind i hate to say she s a jungian shadow but that s what she is did carl jung see this movie she was alive at the time of its release    but probably not 2 now this is a deadly serious sequence right walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman she doesn t even know imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors a night time stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer peering from behind the canvas walls and so forth what does hitchcock show us when walker first comes through the gates concentrating on her victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts bang bang you re dead walker jerks her head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid and when the kid starts to walk away walker darts her cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues her pursuit without another glance that s one way hitchcock treats impending doom 3 the famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses which has been aped innumerable times 4 miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow one of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesn t reach the bell at the top under miriam s delighted and admiring gaze walker smiles and rubs her hands together then picks up the mallet slams it down and the puck bangs against the bell she s thrilled she puts the mallet down looks at her grins and waggles her eyebrows at her like a ten year old showoff 5 after the discovery of miriam s body while whistles blow and people shout walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads her across the intersection gravely holding up her hand to stop the traffic a macabre joke these incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit robert walker s performance is exceptional throughout it s essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish cf ride the pink horse but the menace of the scene is undercut by hitchcock s insistence on irony and distance none of the familiar noir techniques are employed there s nothing really creepy about it and the murder itself is hardly a savage one i don t think that any director other than hitchcock would have handled it the way she did it would have been all menace and shadows hiding places abortive attempts scowls instead of grins not that it s an entirely flawless movie a flawless movie is not yet with us some of the middle section is a bit slow going and farley granger although a nice guy is stolid dull and rather stupid her new girl friend is just dull hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in the wrong man i m not sure hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt the latter was imposed on her at an early age by her catholic education original sin    you re born with it    and all that in filmed interviews she always glibly explained away her fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about her father taking her to the police station to put a scare into her after some peccadillo we re justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory i hope you get the pun i know i know it s strained and inept but i spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up	1
381	looking back at the career of alfred hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary she was for the film industry it is likely a sign of how ahead of her time hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on her mind strangers on a train one of hitchcock s first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits   an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique  arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers strangers on a train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking the brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience s focus even in slower scenes if there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of strangers on a train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing   bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film s most tense and engaging scene these are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film but what really makes strangers on a train stand out is the story premise as hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clich√©e after clich√©e it s wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original sure it s fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today s day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the film s brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while one can t help but notice the deeper themes hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanity s heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as bruno s own cavalier attitude towards death hitch also works in many moments of dark humour bruno popping a child s balloon with her cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easy going environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere this may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable  the antagonistic figure of bruno essayed to perverse perfection by robert walker sadly in her last film role but easily stealing the film from her admittably very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes strangers on a train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming she seems rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess she speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in her eye when discussing different fashions of killing people bruno could seem to represent the id as freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind it makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure guy haines and how bland and uninteresting she seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing  yet despite this implied message hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle she is forced to overcome it s a testament to actor farley granger s talent that despite robert walker s villain easily stealing the show granger s hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character superb support is given by ruth roman who manages to overcome the clich√©e and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure kasey rogers giving a stunning performance as guy s horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and patricia hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director s daughter would imply the superb cast headed by a simply wonderful walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply hitchcock s breathtaking stylistics  all in all strangers on a train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but it s still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago once again hitchcock proves her unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the film s surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience   9 10	1
382	i have used this movie in my college ethics courses for over 10 years also woody allen s crimes and misdemeanors  another terrific multi leveled ethical study  it s fiction i don t focus too much on the unrealistic features of strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels i love the film as gallows comedy tautly told with many ironic twists and visual pleasures  even if it s unbelievable the story is told so well that i don t even think of criticizing its plausibility although i must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me  too much hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion 1 ethical passivity some weaknesses of the guy character are intended by hitchcock a primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one s moral positions guy is unable to effectively block bruno s crazy proposals at the start an interesting question is why and how does guy behave so passively ineffectively a possible answer is her depression because of her intense and complicated divorce process  2 miscommunication guy commits another failure at the start on the train to get away quickly she agrees that bruno s ideas are all good but guy s literal meaning is opposite to her inflected sarcastic meaning bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss cross murders guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement to some extent near the beginning bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck to draw guy further into a web of complicity bruno is manipulating guy guy s linguistic ambiguity on the train gives bruno a chance to put an ethical stranglehold on guy bruno manipulating guy may also take on other meanings     3 secrecy some have speculated about a sexual relationship between guy and bruno it seems at first ridiculous especially since guy appears obviously heterosexual in her relationships with miriam and anne however remember that guy is also ineffective with both women guy appears stereotypically  it s 1951 remember effeminate especially in relationship to bruno guy the strong athlete is weak on the inside bruno is also conflicted playing against herself appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some effeminate traits bruno s fashion and footwork her gushing emotionally to guy in different situations her receiving a manicure from her doting mother bruno kissing and desperately fondling her mother s hand other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from hitchcock s point of view i wish i could hear hitchcock clarify her intended meanings here 4 dishonesty and distrust guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about bruno from family and from police guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover up or a delay in confession again guy is driven by passivity insecurity fear  and perhaps a self hate that is closer to bruno s own self loathing than we care to see or to admit both guy and bruno act out their own parables of impotence 5 lack of evidence guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit herself while quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem guy traps herself with her own doubts and insecurities the absence of desired alibis the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on guy s behalf the obsessive need to appear politically pristine and other personality factors that cause guy to feel defenseless she is as dysfunctional as bruno  just not as dangerous yet one could partially blame guy for miriam s murder 6 disease and mental disorder an interesting question is how legally responsible is bruno for the murders the more ethically incompetent bruno is as a sick sociopath the more guilty guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes guy s failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and death ensues one could argue that more than one crime is committed and that guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice these and many other features of the film make strangers on a train a gem of a morality play a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections	1
383	this is such a revered and studied film a classic among hitchcock s many it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again yet you think can it hold up even when the huge and clever and amazing trick of the plot is no surprise yes and for starters there is the start a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story the gist of it two taxis two men shown with their shoes each walking onto the train sitting then across from each other and oops a mistake a little nudge and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves they are interchangeable  the tone here is characteristic of hitchcock as it is in many horror and suspense films   cheery and light we know entering the film however that this won t be the case so already we are worried what after all is about to go wrong a lot in truly hitchcock fashion it is a purely innocent man nearly always a man who faces injustice who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to her the innocent in this case tennis player guy haynes is played with an innocence that is believable  her collegiate politeness in that first scene for example as she realizes the other man is a little cuckoo is just what you or i might do the not so innocent man is the self  absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child bruno anthony played with utter brilliance by robert walker this uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another hitchcock wacko played by anthony perkins in psycho so from scene one on the train and the train really gorgeous we have the two leads and we have the mind blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot from the first novel by patricia highsmith who also wrote the books behind the two mr ripley movies and it doesn t hurt that the screenplay was co  written by raymond chandler herself who knows something about economy and clever dialog and crime and of course there is more than just the first scene what to note well that smarty of a senator s daughter i thought she was terrific is hitchcock s daughter patricia who is still with us as of 2009 she also had a role in psycho and there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film  the tennis courts in the hamptons known to us as the site of the us open the fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage building up the suspense by making it surreal the fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all and when it collapses in a crash  that s all backprojected on a set one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of her back projections the photography is that perfect hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized as in some noir films that it is an object in its own right look again at the first scene or the shooting and editing of haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder this is sophisticated construction when we are not completely surprised that it s bruno in the bed that only proves that the director has us on our toes something unexpected is always expected are there glitches who knows it depends on what kind of falseness you can accept or embrace as beautiful style the scene where bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant the woman played by norma varden is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away and marred by her looking at the senator s daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses and her resemblance to her earlier victim this is a mid 20th century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of hitchcock s efforts the end of psycho for starters the wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator s daughter this echoes in lots of little ways  two men trail her to the tennis court two men accompany the victim to the amusement park and so on there can be too much made of this but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness don t forget there are meant to be two murders  it is the lack of the second murder the inability to create a doubling in that case that causes bruno to unravel walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot and just afterwards she died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of her outbursts though she appeared in other films strangers on a train is easily her tour de  force farley granger had a long career that never quite saw her break into true stardom though her style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works especially in they live by night  and if you watch this one for the first or third time do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd s heads all move back and forth in unison   except for bruno s she is staring out without moving her head straight at us as the trailer for the movie says after this movie you won t be talking to strangers on a train	1
384	 lets swap murders  your wife my father  seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers   bruno anthony and guy haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey guy a solid respectable tennis player whose problem is that her wife the flirtatious miriam won t divorce her so she can marry senators daughter anne laughs the whole conversation off as a joke the following week she isn t laughing any more in a scene of classic hitchcock suspense bruno stalks miriam through a carnival and strangles her as she does her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses cold hearted and amoral bruno her part of the deal completed approaches an appalled guy expecting even pressuring her into  doing her bit  matters are not helped when anne s precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting guy of miriam s murder so accused of a murder she didn t commit and expected to commit another what is guy going to do the power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature   and this hitchcock does to perfection	1
385	in strangers on a train it s obvious from the start that playboy wastrel robert walker has singled out farley granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders granger s a semi public figure she s a tennis pro but not an especially high one high enough however for her to know that granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry ruth roman so when they meet as complete strangers on a train one afternoon walker knows enough that granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise though granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance she gives that granger just might submit to temptation in fact when walker kills laura elliot granger s wife whose been two timing her and even gotten pregnant by another man she expects that granger will in turn murder walker s father so that walker can inherit her estate today walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that alfred hitchcock directed walker to her career role ironically in her last complete film walker died the following year with most of my son john finished hitchcock does not do too bad by farley granger either  of course when granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to her the tension strangers on a train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which granger has to finish the match and waylay walker before she plants evidence convicting granger at the crime scene and also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between walker and granger strangers on a train is hitchcock at her best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing	1
386	strangers on a train was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing i finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today you can see the inspiration for future action movies here   the climactic ending with the out of control merry go round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de bont s speed of course strangers is over forty years older than speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there   hitchcock was a true genius the not so subtle gay side of bruno robert walker in an amazing performance has taken form in many other psycho stalker figures in future movies consider her a male version of jennifer jason leigh in single white female she knows about guy before she even meets her on the train   we almost get the feeling their contact isn t incidental   and is soon entirely obsessed with her hitchcock loved the oedipial elements in her movies also see psycho for more blatant undertones and there s a lot of that here bruno hates her father and wants her to die so she can be with her mother her effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen   yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non masculine robe flirting with guy and responding to her mother the deep layers of this movie make it a fast paced thriller than you can return to again and again   unfortunately it s being remade as a big budget hollywood production but after seeing the original i honestly can t imagine anything surpassing the sheer white knuckle thrills of this movie	1
387	even though some unrealistic things happen at the end ie a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry go round where any number of innocent could be killed this still was an intense enjoyable thriller one of alfred hitchcock s better films robert walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times her co star in here farley granger is okay but is no match for walker either in acting or in the characters they play it s the typical hitchcock film with some strange camera angles immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc unlike a lot of her other films i thought this one was a fast moving story with a very few dull spots being an ex tennis player i enjoyed her footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies hitchcock s real life daughter patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here she didn t just get the job because of her dad she can act also of note the dvd has both the british and american versions and there were some differences in the story this is a classic film that is still referred to in modern day films even comedies such as throw momma off the train	1
388	alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigo s and the psycho s is this film strangers on a train the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made the story follows guy haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senator s daughter if she can get a divorce from her current wife one day on the way to see her wife she meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that she can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost her her life the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinema s most intriguing and thought provoking of all time what if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone has someone they d like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do her the chances of it happening are unlikely but it s the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could  is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker the man was simply born for the part she manages to capture just the right mood for her character and absolutely commands every scene she is in the character of bruno is a madman but she s not a lunatic she s a calculating conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable her performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality unfortunately robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train and i believe that is a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does but worth mentioning is her co star farley granger granger never really impresses that much but her performance is good enough and she holds her own against walker also notable about her performance is that she portrays her character as a very normal person and that is how it should be ruth roman is guy s wife to be she isn t really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has alfred hitchcock s daughter patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara the sister of guy s fianc√© she is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in alfred hitchcock s direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film there is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses this is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene hitchcock s direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and i don t think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film it s truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that she doesn t only use the script to tell the film s story but she also uses to camera to do so as well strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece	1
389	one would have expected hitchcock s return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution surely few expected her most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy but that is precisely what they got strangers on a train what is remarkable is how much bruno s transgression disrupts the world of the film much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of her life and hence the society she represents or is eager to join guy is the archetypal american the working class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome bruno is her destructive opposite gay decadent  european  she lives off her father in a big house and just lounges about dreaming of murder bruno s life is one of repetition circularity whereas guy moves straight ahead it is bruno s achievement to move guy into her realm represented by the merry go round and force her to transgress break the law hope for murder bruno s bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy all the authority figures in the film are criticised   bruno s father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film especially in aunt clara s paintings   that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere anna s incredibly machiavellian self serving father the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken far from being the mother hater of legend hitch as robin wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy bruno s transgression turns the world topsy turvy this is hitch s most surreal film whenever guy is in her plot she is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music but whenever bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun this is hitch s first truly american film revelling in the primitive detritus of americana grown men puncture little boys  balloons or try to throw them off merry go rounds distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting dali painting there is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of magritte just look at any scene with bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarre phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations   check all those balloons hitch had obviously just seen the third man   as well as in more staid environs washington will never look the same again strangers is also vertigo notwithstanding hitch s most overtly sexual film   as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with  riding  horses the gobsmacking fellatio joke when hitch s daughter spills powder over the policeman and yet hitch doesn t stint on good old suspense in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist she was critics tend to overlook what made her famous in the first place much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing bruno into murder there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which she intends to frame guy down a drain the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success and hitch milks it with callous glee   listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously strangers is one of hitch s five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema the dialogue is so strange and brilliant i can t believe it wasn t written by chandler patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy the fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set piece black comedy and symbolic site if bruno s final words condemn her to hell according to the catholic precepts hitch is supposed to embody compare with a similar ending in the killers we applaud her integrity infinitely preferable to guy s debased serving of self	1
390	cam archer s lyrical bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering beautifully photographed by aaron platt that is more vibe than narrative caught somewhere between documentary and dream bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early todd haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of gus van sant with grit glamour and heartbreak it s kinda like the movie equivalent of sonic youth playing bubblegum pop	1
391	beautifulthat one word pretty much sums up this whole film everything from the cinematography the directing the actingbrilliant at any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say i assure you that after one viewing bobbycrush will be stuck in your head i know this from first hand experience even the soundtrack is great it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film be thankful that cam archer exists in this world we need more people like her to make films that show love and shame in totally real and surreal imagery	1
392	dylan and bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are but dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside bobby knows that she s not interested in girls and misses what she had with dylan  told as part cheesy 80 s pop video part home movie part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad but all too often true story that will hit home with many that see it  this film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but i wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note yes we all love and lose even when we are young but there s always tomorrow especially when we are young	1
393	very enjoyable 50 s western i have it in my collection and recommend it to western fans mostly victor mature s movie and quite well done in my estimation she s a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout red cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions they all joined as scouts after their loss victor has set her eye s on the colonel s wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters 50 s westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction a western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again one to enjoy gave it a 7 rating likely 68 worthy but films like these become more precious over time for film noir fansthe big steal they live by night side street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed bought and viewed noir seems to resemble westerns in a way some long ago and never forever	1
394	i enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love hate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline all the main characters are well cast true john wayne or robert mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well but victor mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling tarzan of sorts reminds me of her film role as samson another difficult but not impossible man to tame the mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts this story supposedly takes place in oregon just before the end of the civil war judging by the volcano in the background of the opening sceneprobably mt lassen the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the cascades as we never see any other civilians however there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of wyoming or montana red cloud the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort is the namesake of a very famous sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865 66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in wyoming and montana fort laramieeastern wyomingis mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort the plains tribe of assiniboines is mentioning as joining red cloud this aspect of the story then bears a general resemblance to historical fact it may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of john ford s fort apache in both cases we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to her first frontier post with native american problems she underestimates the military prowess of her adversaries regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote her career in both films she pays dearly for her inexperience in dealing with the enemy also in common the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local native americans and wants to tell her what is wise to do and not to do in both films we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander s heart and a subordinate which the commander does everything to squelch clearly the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion i also see certain resemblances with the misfits the soldiers as a whole including the commander are misfits of a sortas one of them admits mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting native americans the commander s wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort thus is inherently a misfit with a husband who is very uncertain of her future in the army the trappers in turn are also misfits not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army generated antagonism by red cloud  finally we can also compare this story with anthony mann s later film the far country starring jimmy stewart in stewart s case she can choose to return to being a loner cowboy at the end but mature s character doesn t come up with an appetizing new way of being her own boss red cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate besides she has an obsession with the commander s wife	1
395	victor mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led her men to get cut to ribbons by confederate artillery at shiloh and is sent to a fort in oregon for her incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel s wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man s wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature s older and wiser mountain man father figure directed by anthony mann this film is lost among her more famous westerns with james stewart but even so you really don t need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although preston gets to prove her bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout	1
396	this is another good westernwhich i enjoyedit s not an epic or anythingbut it is good for what it isit  about 3 fur trappersled by a men named jedwho is crude and uncivilizedjed and her two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian bandwho resent the americans on their landand want to take it backthat s the gist of the storywhat follows is actionexcitementeven a bit of humourand forbidden romanceone of jed s friendsgusreminded me a lot of the character quintplayed by robert shawin the movie jawsthey both have that crustygruff demeanoranywayif you re a western fanyou should find lots to like about this particular entryi think it deserves a 7 10	1
397	one of the more obscure of anthony mann s westerns the last frontier was also her only cavalry western aside from one brief episode in winchester  73 though naturally she focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals set not in her beloved high country but in the foothills and forests it s a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways her fort apache without the need to preserve the legend this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by her superiors badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer victor mature and james whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it s the army s fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead but despite the best efforts of guy madison s amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make her fit to wear the uniform the arrival of robert preston s humiliated colonel eager to revenge herself on the tribe that drove her out of her own outpost ¬ñ and mature s clumsy infatuation with the colonel s wife anne bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who s tired of being saved by men who think they know what s best for her ¬ñ soon drive matters into much darker territory it s not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them little wonder that at one point mature throws away the bluecoat she has long coveted in disgust screaming i would have died for this but it s nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag the stallone of her day mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director this is not one of her better days despite having her most complex part perversely enough as a simple man ¬ñ well meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to her character in the kentuckian but robert preston s ahab like colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career she destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps her out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in her obsession to redeem her career she moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by her sense of shame at her wife s sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades she regards as her inferiors she s beyond salvation but there s still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity ¬ñ she genuinely admires madison s courage in making a futile attempt to get preston s orders countermanded by their superiors ¬ñ fatally skewed though it is like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of mann s typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia s dvd with the image often dark 2551 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial and error and grainy	1
398	 `the last frontier  is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers jed victor mature gus james whitmore and mongo pat hogan and their relationships with the army particularly captain riordon guy madison colonel marstonrobert preston and corrina marston colonel s wife anne bancroft hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the indians jed gus and mungo adjust to living the `civilized  life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier  jed who has been raised by gus both inspires and looks up to the `older  gus and mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization  her real problems start after she becomes strongly attracted to the colonel s wife corrina colonel marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around her with her dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what she could be and jed for what she is caught in the middle is captain riordon a brave and likeable man torn among her duty to the army her strong friendship with jed and her fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel s recklessness  what makes this movie so interesting as well as entertaining is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `the last frontier  are exactly the same elements forget the insipid title and dated music first the screenplay almost all of the subplots particularly the reckless colonel have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity just when you think you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a different direction possible spoiler `the last frontier  being a `production code  movie back in the day the word `virgin  was taboo it s very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner i expected either jed or the colonel s wife to reap some retribution for their sin i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn t exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending second the casting mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed the wild eyed innocent raised in the woods  james whitmore who plays gus `the man who raised jed  is actually five years younger than mature nevertheless mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time most notably burt lancaster and kirk douglas none could have played jed better preston also mature s junior plays colonel marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man however preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel s rank bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as corrina bancroft s dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for winona ryder `edward scissorhands  and christina ricci `sleepy hollow  that is i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why i believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades further bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston yep she could be a colonel s wife madison walks a careful balancing act as riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogueplaying a role similar to that of john wayne in `fort apache  madison does a more skillful job at it this movie has a `silverado  type camaraderie that alone makes it worth seeing it also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction i just hope a letterbox version is available many have been lost because this movie takes full advantage of that format	1
399	ordinarily anthony mann made westerns with  the big guys    james stewart gary cooper henry fonda    the a list cowboy stars but in this b+ film she tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a trapper  mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films   robert redford in jeremiah johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man   vulgar crude animalistic   is the central figure and it s something to see giving mature one of her better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a self absorbed custer type cavalry commander and james whitmore the poor man s spencer tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer s wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature s grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that she s attracted to her rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in her masterful fort apache the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around	1
400	a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because she won t  go along with the program  and sets out to let the world know what they re missing the supporting cast is great as well and the music is the soul of the film i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library	1
401	the sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore sort of a soul version of the more well known the last of the blonde bombshells ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re uniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows her exploits as well as those of the group members a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque derrick o connor and antonio fargas not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold	1
402	better than average world war ii era who dun it featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight crime doctor s courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems the link to courage is not particularly clear this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr ordway labels murder hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso   a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes her sister that disappears on stage as a mystery novelist jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good direction production design and photography stand out the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average b detective thriller strongly recommended	1
403	another nice entry in the crime doctor series #4 10 with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets and a more off the wall storyline too a man who looks like the insane murderer of her first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party the crime doctor is on the scene ostensibly as a guest to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie the irreplaceable butler or odds on jerome cowan police inspector emory parnell had her work cut out but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong on breaking into the murder room ordway says right through the centre of the forehead and cowan replies she didn t miss this time favorite bits baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party the scene where the braga s place of repose is seemingly rumbled the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn t do either well worth a watch if you already like the genre you won t be disappointed unless you really don t like the genre	1
404	i saw this on tcm recently and through the imdb i found that there were seven crime doctor movies with warner baxter as the psychiatrist detective baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to her stolid performance in 42nd street a decade earlier not noir and a bit campy today the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural the plot black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr moto and charlie chan series there are subplots unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately none ever made it to the a status it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes i would love to see a boxed dvd series of these films	1
405	note after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film my mistake i thought imdb for a database for movies not tv shows but since most people will look up this film under bagdad cafe and not out of rosenheim which strangely is the name this film is listed under on imdb i ll leave this comment here maybe i missed something but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series    which must have been loosely based on this film i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film this film is not like a tv show at all and whoopie goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars other than jack palance who was very charming in her role this is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie which is probably why the what s a nice word for idiots who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one first of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get go from the music which is just part of the time so you can t really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool story a german or bavarian woman very pretty and quite plump gets in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with her   she taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert like highway out in the middle of nowhere she finds the small and dilapidated but charming bagdad cafe in bagdad california and checks in the rest of the story is magic i don t want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprise warning if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involved i gave this film a 10 for orginality entertainment and sheer delightfulness	1
406	you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when whistling in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s on top of some weak one liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far fetched as the tales the fox red skelton tells her radio audience you have to wonder why anyone would think she could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it but then that s how unrealistic the comedy is but  if you re a true red skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the  40s  you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting her ann rutherford and virginia grey do nicely as her love interest and conrad veidt as always makes an interesting villain one of her more amusing moments is her reaction to skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans i never knew that she muses impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced all in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one liners has simply worn off	1
407	red skelton plays a radio detective known as the fox in whistling in the dark also starring ann rutherford conrad veidt eve arden virgina grey and rags ragland wally benton aka the fox finds her plans to marry her fianc√© carol rutherford thwarted when she s kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult veidt joseph jones veidt has just learned that her cult the silver haven is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman s nephew who is going to be living off of the interest she wants wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with her attorney for backup and because she s not sure which one is wally s fianc√© jones kidnaps carol and also the radio sponsor s daughter grey this to me anyway is a superior film to the second entry in this series whistling in dixie the plot is better the cast is better there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes skelton when she s not making faces and rolling her eyes is quite amiable and rutherford is very good veidt always played these evil men to perfection eve arden is wally s agent who arranges a date for her and grey to make sure her contract is renewed i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s onward she was always a good looking woman but who knew she was such a knockout in the  30s and  40s this is a fun film with a neat cast	1
408	there are 3 of these movies all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing red plays radio sleuth wally benton aka the fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with her fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker ann rutherford many of the one liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated but just as many actually made me laugh out loud which was unexpected to say the least red skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who s charm really didnt play well in my formidable years i have to give these movies the go ahead though  if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare i almost threw in light hearted but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it the suspense at times is well above average as with most movies from this era it gets a pi politically incorrect rating for reasons you can well imagine wartime is funny that way i guess and so then again are these movies watch one watch them all	1
409	red skelton in her first starring role plays wally benton who plays  the fox  on a radio show she writes the murder mysteries and as  the fox  solves them joseph jones conrad veidt is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone she kidnaps benton her girlfriend ann rutherford and another girlfriend virginia grey she tells benton to write out the perfect murderor her girlfriends get it very funny and enjoyable movie fast moving it s only 77 minutes a good script and perfect casting really puts this across skelton is very good in her first starring role  very funny fast handsome and intelligent veidt is excellent as the evil jones rutherford and grey are lots of fun as skelton s girlfriends all three of them play off each other perfectly  their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic also fun to see eve arden in a small role well worth your time	1
410	while many pass this off as a b movie it is indeed a first class comedy that is well written and acted red skelton is great as wally benton better known to radio fans as the fox ann rutherford is perfect as wally s fiance carol lambert conrad veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals i read one account of this movie which states that vincente minelli directed this film not unless she changed her name to s sylvan simon who directed all three of the fox movies this is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged so get over your black and white prejudice if you have one sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy this was also red s first starring role take note during the climax of the reference to orson welles  war of the worlds broadcast	1
411	is there any question that jeffrey combs is one of the true horror greats this movie seriously doesn t suck and is sort of funny watching a young combs at work is great but i wish she had had more lines look out for beyond re animator it s going to kick some azz	1
412	look this movie is obscure brilliant and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary i suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin nevertheless we could only pray for the chance to see this one on dvd i would say that it even beats the great phatasm if you like a dark movie with plenty of spooky imagery look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be	1
413	legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad radzoff splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne dies of a heart attack a bunch of drama school students steal radzoff s corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating her grave writer director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga booga atmosphere the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a juicy decapitation the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b flick faces mayne has a deliciously eye rolling ball with her flashy role leon askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed up director wolfgang nita talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs rohmer plus there are nice turns by luca bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader saint jennifer starrett as the sweet meg jeffrey combs as the geeky stu and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo popping up in cool bits are chuck porky mitchell as a detective patrick wright in one of her customary policeman parts and tallie cochrane as a corpse joel king s polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot a fun little fright flick	1
414	ugh what an embarrassing episode last night it was either a failed script for abc afterschool special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic pc anti gun homily from 1974 the gun in fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn t of the gun being melted down like in the movie no i m not some nra shill it s just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in her head that i should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of her personal cause i d appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn t delivered via 2 by 4 geez ok the sociology lesson is over the message has been delivered the important episode has been aired now let s get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence	1
415	i have never missed an episode david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive it certainly beats out that csi crap i love the storyline and would actually like to see her as a cop again someday i give the show a 10	1
416	ahhi didn t order no amazing hit showwe ll you got one hack is simply the greatest television show ever made a little bit of me died when i flicked on the tv one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn t on the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture i found that at the end of any episode i watched i walked away having been both entertained and informed i am actually dumber now that hack is gone i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate since hack has been gone i see them as eyesore s and an unneeded strain on taxpayers so for the love of god we need to bring back hack	1
417	he s not your conventional cab driver this guys got issues with her wife with her son a priest all her fares her ex partner and most of all herself and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it so we have to keep watching to find out more about her past the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so i think this is a great show and i hope people catch on before the season s over  watch this show	1
418	this is not your run of the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases the episodes so far are more realistic and intelligent if you are looking for something with a lot of butt kicking rambo style cop story you will not find it here i gave it a 9 i wish this series lives long morse is excellent	1
419	everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetchedwell maybe a do good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little at least the cab drivers ive met but that s what makes the show great the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end she never wins in life david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role her supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action i watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story line every week it s also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks she drives by or know what intersection she s at i love this show and i love philly give this show a shot	1
420	it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change as an added bonus it is nice to see some local home boys from massachusetts making good in la i hope this show will be a keeper	1
421	an extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast one of the few shows that i try to watch on a regular basis glad to see bebe neuwirth in a recurring role but feel andre braugher is underutilized she is one intense actor hope cbs gives it a better time slot next season	1
422	okay so this series kind of takes the route of  here we go again  week in week out david morse s character helps out her ride who is in a bit of a pickle   but what s wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have her in a series created by david koepp   a great writer   is heaven due to the lack of love for this show by many i can t see it going to a season series   but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me   let s hope something good can make it past a first series	1
423	i like hack think the lone ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in philadelphia doing her best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and you ve got the synopsis david morse is nearly perfect as olshansky she helps people but instead of riding silver in the old west she drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary philly without handing out silver bullets the supporting cast is first class and well above average at times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series the rockford files this show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9pm fridayeastern	1
424	i love this show it s clever and very well acted david morse and andre braugher have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode i m always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphy s absence at this point in the second season as david morse ex wife heather she added such character to the show i think this show is a credit to the crime drama genre with that said   i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique	1
425	i am sick of series with young and clueless people talking about their problems all the time self centered boring and absolutely annoying popular dawson s creek beverly hills etc hack is a breath of fresh air with a great actor david morse a completely different plot credible people with real problems thank god  and very very good histories i just love it i hope hack will go on for a long time because it is a great television series for grown up people for a change	1
426	david morse and andre braugher are very talented actors which is why i m trying so hard to support this program unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me i m hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them	1
427	i have only see three episodes of hack starring david morse and it looks as though i ve missed 37 episodes well thats if itv 3 are showing them in chronological order i ve just watched  misty blue  episode 38 i have really enjoyed the 3 episodes but then i m a david morse fan esp st elsewhere for any one reading this hack is excellent pity its being aired on itv 3 the cast is strong though i cant get used to the idea of david playing a bent cop still we all know she s the good guy wrongly accused i see gary cole has guest starred what ever happened to  midnight caller  just wonder if hack is available on dvd yet lovin it cheers	1
428	hey i didn t order no cab yeah well you got one what can i say about hackwhat a man among men she was a heartened ex cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold if you were able to and fortunately for america s tv viewersone person per week was penetrate the cold hard surface of hack s exterior you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice the show was superb i laughed i cried i smiledall in the same episode my arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend hack would exit her cab in another dark alleywith nothing more than her fistsready to avenge a wronged civilian a smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley s facial expressions when the taxi of justice s headlights illuminated upon her face week after week i canceled my duties as president of the klingon association to bask in the warmth glow of hack s brilliance i have never seen a better show and i mourned the loss of one of america s greatest treasures when the show was canceled in other hack related news i would like to announce to the world that my wife and i are expecting hack koen to come into the world in about three weeks	1
429	it seems that hack has been described as un realistic but that s what tv is tv is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and i feel hack does a great job in that regard add to this the slow process of revealing her past and engaging interesting plots you just can t seem to get enough plus with such great actors as david morse andre braugher and even little mathew borish what more can you ask for so if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters i suggest giving hack a chance especially now that it s finally getting off its feet	1
430	to keep it as simple as possible this is a very good show that is well written and has a fantastic cast it s not loaded with blood and guts and centers around a disgraced cop and her relationship with her ex wife her son her former partner andre braugher her childhood friend now a priest george dzunzda and lastly the person who happens to get into her hack in that episode are you likely to find something like this going on in your city no is this still a good story yes and it s nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of her flaws watch more then one  2 3 and you ll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show and thank you david morse for making this character so interesting another good job	1
431	i made a promise that if ever i posted a comment that was less than complimentary then later felt different about it i would return and make known my change of heart so far this is the first time it s happened  i m really starting to enjoy hack something has clearly changed the storylines seem to be much stronger the plot may still be a tad surreal but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven i attribute this to fine acting  not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner some need time to pick up speed i m glad i kept watching this program and i really hope it lasts	1
432	i am not a fan of musicals but i am a huge fan of jean renoir and jean gabin i rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director this movie is beautiful the shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors strive for but renoir masters i cannot express how much this movie transcends itself it s not really a musical it just has a couple of well placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale but there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute joy when watching it i am a fan of foreign art films but i m also a meathead who loves things like die hard and schwarzenegger movies i get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible    not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10	1
433	as a longtime admirer of the 2001 film moulin rouge and a more recent admirer of jean renoir s film making i knew that i d inevitably watch her french cancan sooner or later the movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the moulin rouge nightclub the impresario danglard jean gabin tries to turn montmartre laundress nini fran√ßoise arnoul into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of her tempestuous mistress the belly dancing lola maria felix this is just one of several love triangles in french cancan  true to stereotype these french showbiz folk are always falling in love renoir directs with her typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie gabin perfectly incarnates the aging french playboy hero arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used french cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation the actor who plays her philippe clay is fun to watch  a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortions the movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together the dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in moulin rouge in fact if i have one complaint about french cancan it s that the whole thing is a little too technicolor even when nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy it s just that i can t help thinking that things weren t ever this colorful and innocent in real life	1
434	like classic hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse a must see for those interested in french music hall including a song by √©dith piaf and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale the dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan some might object to the technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets consider it jean renoir s love letter to the paris she grew up in certainly the jean renoir film for people who don t like her serious films or who only like her hollywood productions 	1
435	this was a pleasant musical about the creation of the moulin rouge dance hall in many ways this reminds me of the hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s in that it has many clich√©s leading up to the inevitable conclusion will the show still go on while of course none of this is new it was enjoyable and well made the musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch in many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of the great ziegfeld in real life ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the american film but in french cancan the characters have fully functioning libidos  but nothing is really shown so the movie is okay for kids nothing new but well done nevertheless	1
436	i just viewed jean renoir s wonderful film french can can it is a visual delight and a great entertainment the recently produced moulin rouge pales by comparison i didn t quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received now i m convinced more than ever that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like jean renoir s version of the same story she succeeded in getting great performances out of her entire cast and the great french actor jean gabin was in rare form the dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one i d ever seen it was long but i didn t want it to end this film deserves to receive more recognition than it s got	1
437	jean renoir s homage to the paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways not only does it appear to have been photographed by toulouse lautrec and mucha it portrays the geographic paris the streets accessible only by staircases the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by hollywood there is an obvious comparison to be made with lloyd bacon s 42nd street which had been made about 20 years before featuring ruby keeler as a dancing sensation a fresh faced kid from the sticks who had come to new york to get into show business who saves the show when the star fails  you re going out there a kid from the chorus but you ve got to come back a star warner baxter s julian marsh is a director who suffers for her art and is unappreciated jean gabin s danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics but when she talks about the show she is more like knute rockne than like julian marsh she s all about the game except  for her pointy thing she has a profitable new venture sewed up until her mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as her next mistress her prospects rise and fall with every coital journey she takes  danglard takes mistress 1 lola de castro played by maria felix slumming to a dive where she sees nini fran√ßoise arnoul with her boyfriend and first lover paulo the baker and discovers that she is a spirited dancer she uses her charm and the prospect of money to lure nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage the prospect of money and fame charms nini and she become danglard s next mistress as well as an apt student of the cancan which danglard has dubbed french cancan to cater to the current anglophile tendency in the dance both 42nd st and french cancan are tributes to show business  to modern entertainment  that has is own iconography and its own conceit 42nd st is centered around julian marsh a great director of broadway shows which she organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement the male juvenile is a middle aged twit with lumbago replaced by dick powell the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide danglard on the other hand goes from woman to woman seducing them with the promise of fame hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment one has no doubt that she is heterosexual and quite active postcoital scenes abound days after seducing nini away from paulo she has discovered esther a piaf type and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film s theme song while she plays it on her fiddle that of course arouses nini s jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of lola and of course nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a czarina the whole movie is about how danglard s concupiscence has cost her money but how even her troublesome horniness is subordinate to her love for the show  how the audience demands devotion  and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes danglard the hero while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men at the movie s conclusion danglard having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes approaches a new attraction watching the incredible and believe me it is incredible performance of the cancan have you ever thought about being on the stage she asks and the curtain descends meanwhile poor julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to peggy sawyer s new fans disparage her contribution to the show s success i won t even go into 42nd street s central line oh guy it was grand of you to come  furthermore i won t go into the glimpse one gets of legendary parisian entertainers including a brief vision of piaf nor of the vision of a paris both urban and rural certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered trenet and aznavour but it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity something unseen in any hollywood musical with which it might be compared is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30 s hollywood musicals including my beloved fred astaire not to mention dick powell let alone the barf promulgated by mgm in movies like the repulsive american in paris all those fountains we ll save our comparison of that turkey to breakfast at tiffany s and its deconstruction of the american male for another day that danglard may have been a hopeful vision in postwar france of a kind of hyper masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed is practically beside the point that she is a man s man neither john wayne nor edward everett horton is perhaps more on target that she is a man who likes the ladies is never in question i for one wouldn t mind living her life at all i wonder if gabin was that lucky  at the beginning of this comment i wanted to talk about baz luhrman and what sinclair lewis called boloney i never got that far baz s moulin rouge well paris doesn t put that kind of stuff in the seine anymore	1
438	there are frames in this film that could be renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds the humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star the can can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an american dance sequence	1
439	renoir s tale of paristhe cancana washer girl and the moulin rougea more subduedbut highly entertaining version of the opening of the moulin rouge jean gabin gives her usual excellent performancethe technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisitean easy evening s viewing chris w galla	1
440	although it doesn t seem very promising for a long stretch renoir s french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film the story is clich√© a laundry girl nini fran√ßoise arnoul is discovered by a night club owner danglard jean gabin danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops her current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too i m glad the film didn t go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have the film ends with the opening of danglard s new night club the moulin rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers the first of them complainte de la butte which also provides the base of most of the film s musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and renoir herself wrote it if you re a fan of baz luhrmann s 2001 film moulin rouge you ll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by rufus wainwright although it isn t very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen it s hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 8 10	1
441	french cancan is one of my favorite all time movies it s an excellent film there s color there s humor there s music it s a very good portrait of the so called belle √©poque though jean renoir s priorities were always to show a creation a fantasie so the film isn t a historical movie the final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images it s a film you shouldn t miss	1
442	this is my favorite renoir from the fifties it s the story of how henri danglard built and launched the moulin rouge nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described gabin is in great form as the easy going danglard  see her deal humorously with nini s violent boyfriend gianni esposito is moving as the wistful prince who is courting nini maria felix with that amazon s body is imposing as the egotistical lola danglard s first lover finally fran√ßoise arnoul as nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for danglard and becoming her girl is just stunning her loveliness and pert charm will win you over a bonus we get edith piaf patachou andr√© claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the moulin rouge	1
443	i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed this can can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre like stanley donen and gene kelly musical but in french way and a jean renoir nice tribute to her time her friends lovers music and dances it is at same time a show business chronicle of that age full of affection and french mood it is too a clear tribute to the impressionism people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture it is particularly a tribute to toulouse lautrec and of course to jean renoir father pierre auguste you will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some renoir master work excellent casting scenery sound effects and music even it tell us about the creation of parisian moulin rouge obviously it is a fiction story and not very original by the way as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on but the jean renoir production is great 	1
444	uncle frank is everyone s uncle this documentary covered all aspects of aging in america the lonliness the humor the irony uncle frank and aunt tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience the director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives thanks to everyone who helped in making this film	1
445	this film works on a lot of different levels it s a profile of one very cool couple a social commentary on aging and nursing homes a love story a musical i ve seen uncle frank a few times and every time i watch it i m not sure who to go call first  my parents my wife a friend i ve lost touch with   but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life  and want to reaffirm the ones that continue expect a lot of laughs and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord i m pretty sure they will	1
446	it doesn t matter whether you ve experienced the plight of the elderly in america or if you re just plain clueless uncle frank and matthew ginsburg give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the roses sort of way by the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow you ve also been educated a terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field matthew ginsburg is a name to pay attention to	1
447	the silver screen gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life s rainbows there s plenty of silver hair on this silver screen but the film s namesake is more like 85 going on 25 with her energy humor and lust for life the story of entertainer extraordinaire uncle frank her devoted wife aunt tillie and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to live each day as if it s your last and brings a glimmer of hope to those often dreaded golden years a great movie for young and old audiences	1
448	anatole litvak directed the 1959 film the journey starring yul brynner deborah kerr robert morley eg marshall anne jackson and jason robards the film takes place during the 1956 hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of budapest because of political problems in that part of the world they are put on a bus to vienna but the russians led by major surov brynner confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning one of the passengers is paul fleming robards posing as an american but in reality a hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being smuggled out of hungary in fact lady ashmore kerr is hiding her she becomes the focus of the major s romantic attentions very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the cold war and all of the performances are wonderful brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate major who isn t all bad and anne jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesn t want her child born in a communist country good script good director good cast   there should be more films like this highly recommended	1
449	there have been many excellent comments about this movie and i want to add my voice to the praise yul brynner has never been more powerfully attractive her major surov was riveting your eyes just cannot leave the screen when she s on it this is her movie this is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially deborah kerr and anne jackson as they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances for example i have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time i noticed the reaction of the german girl when she came face to face with a russian soldier even though she was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in germany after wwii and was most likely gang raped by the red army the possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again please put it on dvd	1
450	most people will consider that yul brynner s greatest performance was as the ruler of siam in the king and i certainly it gave her a wide variety of moods to test her abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful it also showed her to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer finally as it was also her tony award winning performance from broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great broadway performance as well but she did other movies that showed her talents as well as the king and i her comic turn in once more with feeling was quite nice so was her performance as general bunin in anastasia or her ramses in the ten commandments yet she came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to eric von stroheim as the man you love to hate a certain vulnerability in her acting and roles endeared her to the movie public even after her best years as a star were behind her   and she retreated more and more to repeating the king of siam on television and the stage to me her finest performance is in this 1959 drama with deborah kerr jason robards jr robert morley e g marshall anne jackson and ronnie howard the film is set in pretty modern times   the powder keg that was hungary in 1956 when briefly it looked like the iron curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of hungarian patriot imre nagy and her supporters but the hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad timing the russians and their polish and east german allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed nagy and other reformers the west stood by and let this happen england and france had gotten caught in the suez crisis and the us had berated them and israel for attacking egypt due to the actions of three close allies of the us the west found it hard to condemn the overkill of the soviet union it was an unfortunate situation and the hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it in the film brynner is major surov a russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the hungarian revolt one of whom is paul kedes jason robards kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through hungary led by robert morley including marshall jackson and howard and kerr the latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired and brynner mingles with them hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of robards but brynner is human   she tries to be ingratiating with these people all of whom see her as a monster and in sequence when she has drunk a little too much she confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 how is it even if one notes that russia had stalin in charge that relations between russia and the west collapsed so quickly the allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after yalta and potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted did they have to surov is a good officer but she is torn in half by loyalty to the communist regimes in the soviet union and in hungary that she supports and her growing fondness towards kerr who is hiding robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the russian major and as the film reaches it s tragic climax we watch as surov has to decide if she will follow her sense of duty or take pity on kerr robards and the other westerners who want to leave it becomes a true struggle for her   and one that she may win far too late it was a great film about a tragedy of post war europe and possibly the most thoughtful role yul brynner ever portrayed	1
451	yul brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of 50s  she play a role of russian leader in hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the marxism the script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from hungary to england the best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian majoryul brynner in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from her bad works  but at the end she made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in her book a good working to gain at the end peoples agreement and trustment after her assassination by the hungarian resistance	1
452	the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of 1958 in vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in her early years despite the political problems which influenced the movie s success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and yul brynner their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major surov and diana ashmore another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george tabori the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didn t know if diana and the other travelers could leave hungary because the communist major discovers that diana s friend paul kedes is hungarian and she isn t allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why she doesn t want to let her go but after she embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses her too she lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including paul while surov is shot several times by some hungarians so she dies yul brynner is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an english lady yul and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction anatole litvak is in my opinion at her best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who restore and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible	1
453	as a big dostoyevsky fan i had always been disappointed with hollywood s halfhearted attempts to get into the russian romantic aesthetic    case in point yul brynner as dmitri karamazov i had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions but then i saw yul as major surov and changed my mind when given an intelligent script to work with she suddenly came alive and was as noble sexy and conflicted as you could ever want a neurotic russian officer to be so she was a better dmitri as major surov than she was as dmitri but that s because writer tabori actually gave yul as the conflicted russian officer the kind of conflicted russian officer lines that are worthy of real literature and that have real meaning and pathos in them for example a propos of folk music she says musingly you hear a man crying in the dark and if you listen carefully enough you know what she cries for you look surprised lady ashmore despite what you may have heard tractors and marxism aren t the only things the russian cares for there is always time for music brilliant	1
454	a great movie with a rather unclear political message it¬¥s shot in a theatrical style ic most of the action takes place inside mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other emotions run high since the western tourists and business people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern russian charm of the mayor although she makes every effort to understand their point of view the two opposite world views are made pointedly clear but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie	1
455	i really enjoy this movie the first time it was on turner classic movies all the actors did very well but brynner steals the show again like always  she is so sexythis is one of the movie that you do see brynner s emotions actually this movie this is the first i ever seen her laugh because she plays very strong larger than life and serious roles in other movies in this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of brynner brynner seems to be a ladies man in this moviethat is amazing how brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in her russian tongue it drives me crazy in love i don t understand when both brynner and kerr  they both have very good chemistry stars in a movie together and then brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you the king and i in a way	1
456	yul brynner is major surov a singing dancing vodka drinking russian officer stationed near the austrian  hungarian border during the hungarian uprising of 1956 in anatole litvak s the journey though the film has yet to be released on video or dvd it remains one of brynner s most compelling performances because of the political unrest a group of travelers cannot fly out of budapest but are put on a bus to vienna before they can reach the border however their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the russians led by major surov the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country indeed lady ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger paul fleming jason robards jr who pretends to be an american but fools no one she is helping fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused her among the other passengers are a british journalist played by robert morley an american family played by eg marshall her wife anne jackson and their two children one of which is the screen debut of little ron howard major surov takes a romantic interest in lady diana ashmore deborah kerr and a romance of sorts develops between them she offers her nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip however though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats the cold war intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing it remains however one of my favorite yul brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for her passionate performance	1
457	i have seen several yul brynner films  yet this is her best performance as the camera captures her emotions in close up as she snarls smiles and laughs brynner might have been equally arresting in ten commandments taras bulba the magnificent seven the brother karamazov and the mad woman of chaillot but none of these films have captured her range of talent in close ups as in this one she is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is deborah kerr the script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive  she reprised this sort of role years later in the night of iguana the film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the russians in fact she is shown as running away from the russian major in contrast to the maupassant story or the isak denisen story yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the kerr character kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view but she is a superb actress she puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays which often clashes with the spirit of the character it is this contradiction that makes her roles in the journey quo vadis and the night of iguana memorable why is this an unusual film it is not easy in hollywood to see russian characters portrayed as good people  dr zhivago was an exception brynner s romance of a horse thief was again great cinema by abraham polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards leftists in the post mccarthy era the film is also unusual in its casting  great french actors gerard oury and anouk aimee  rub shoulders with jason robards jr and british actor robert morley in many ways the film is international than american all four are great actors and add to the entertainment those who have read maupassant and denisen s works will find the film is not true to either work yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized censored version has a dignified charm of its own  provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group i think litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film while entwining bits of both written tales eg the last bus ride and the final kiss but i do have one grouse  why do hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories only recently eg insomnia have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits	1
458	set during the hungarian revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle jason robards out of hungary into austria however three things complement the story making this an extremely good movie first the actors use the actual languages of their roles the russian soldiers speak only russian the hungarians only hungarian the germans only german except to the minimal extent to tell the story since debra kerr is english she speaks only english and of course yul brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented english as a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount the viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when she she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film no subtitles are necessary second i was in hungary in 1995 and i m telling you this movie has it right on from the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible if i didn t eat in the actual restaurant in the movie i ate at its double i thought that i actually walked down the main street in that village actually the film was shot in austria third and most important this movie reunites deberah kerr and yul brynner after the king and i and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of oscar qualified of course yul already received an oscar for playing that relationship so the acadamy wasn t going to give her another one but that is the quality of the film don t miss this one	1
459	the journey is a romantic version of the cold war it s about an english woman deborah kerr trying to smuggle her former love a hungarian scientist jason robards jr out of hungary during the hungary revolt in 1956 she s on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of hungary through the austrian border of course the bus gets stopped by the russians for a security check the russian officer in charge yul brynner becomes attracted to the english woman deborah kerrand delays the trip of course the russian officer knows the truth about the hungarian scientist posing as a british citizen but she decides not to arrest the scientist because she is waiting for the english woman to come to her of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch despite the romantic flow of dialogue between mr brynner and ms kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting the good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue perhaps some people involved in the hungarian revolt would not appreciate this movie they would consider it a piece of fluff  this is my favorite yul brynner role she speaks with her own masculine voice and is very attractive especially when she becomes vulnerable this is deborah kerr s second time working with yul brynner since they made the king and i in 1956 they make a very attractive couple too bad they never worked again this was the second sexy role ms kerr took since from here to eternity despite the fact that ms kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual  the fine supporting cast was headed by jason robards jr in her first film role some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance robert morley from england however the rest of the actors i have never seen before or since were just great in the movie in the background it was fun to see senta berger as one of the maids speak a few lines of hungarian a few years later in 1966 she was in a movie cast a giant shadow with yul brynner as her leading lady she is still working today	1
460	set in hungary in november 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness her internal struggle between right and wrong her search for the truth and her need to feel emotions for other human beings she was saddened by the fact that her job had alienated her from her friends and enemies alike and she yearned for social contact robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upper lipped englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light hearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why she had so many roles throughout her career deborah kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again 8 10	1
461	very literate intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the hungary of 1956 by invading russian communist regime kerr and robards play lovers she a british baroness she a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do her bit for her country other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson & e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons including ronny howard in her screen debut jackson s character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon to be communist country she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we ve come to know today from redgrave fonda & streep leading the pack of soviet wolves is yul brynner magnificent as a commandant and at her sexiest since she played opposite kerr in the king and i she is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by her attraction to the lovely patrician & heroic kerr this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film do not miss it	1
462	good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through her storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially it s two people in a room it doesn t race through like many modern films but doesn t drag either bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her  career  choices   so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep self examination of her soulbrundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off  buddy  very well a bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things but definitely worth watching	1
463	i just saw this film at the sidewalk film festival in birmingham al which was actually a really fun festival and was blown away by it it was the best movie i saw all day by a long shot a school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together it s an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality story stems from real life occurrences ripped straight from the headlines raw blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end the film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity definitely not suitable for kids too depressing for some people s tastes definitely worth checking out in my opinion though	1
464	although it was dark depressing and at times hard to watch you are alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog it truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships in addition the soundtrack was amazing the lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie  jessica bohl is the best actress i have ever watched her compelling and believable performance made the movie it made me wonder if she really is a prostitute who knows anyway the movie was very worth seeing love your sister yeah that s right	1
465	one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint this movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen there are no bad guys or good guys bechard makes sure of that the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been through bechard s use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of fast food movies and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable   you love the feeling it gives you i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell thank you gorman bechard for proving that false run don t walk to see this movie	1
466	this really is a movie that you need to see twice when i first saw this film i was really drawn into the story while the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room the stories that buddy nick drake wonderful allusion and daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels the soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly dark lo fi and intriguing when you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending i have seen in a long time i hope to see this movie find a distributor for the dvd so that it will be more accessible great movie you won t be disappointed	1
467	i had actually considered investing in this movie when gorman was out drumming up funding i loved most of the script but did not like the ending gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be seeing the completed movie i have to say i am amazed reading the script i had not imagined the acting and gorman s directing would be as powerful and moving as it is here the two leads did an amazing job they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don t read further as you need to see the movie first i actually wish i had never read the script just so i could have experienced the movie ending first hand                                spoiler  i have two main problems with the movie first off and i m sure i mentioned this when i read the script the wife should have died if she were dead the ending would be much more believable as it is we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left her  years ago  if she left her and she is still in love after so long she d have to be seriously delusional but she doesn t come across that way in the script there is also the problem of why she did not expend all this energy going after the wife she still loves plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling reciprocating love and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable however i don t buy daphne doing what she does in the ending i d need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl very naive for a whore but believable due to bohl s performance did what she did the character is simply not cold enough and if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the movie story missing much of this movie is reminiscent of sex lies and video tape i think it could have been as popular if gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending  so watch the movie enjoy the performance and make up your own mind	1
468	i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival world premiere a haunting intimate portrait of loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker the acting of the two leads jessica bohl & richard brundage is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan exotica and raymond carver where i m calling from the soundtrack tywanna jo baskette crooked fingers is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself highly recommend the film and the soundtrack	1
469	this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending or maybe a crying game surprise and the best soundtrack i ve probably ever heardif that all make sense the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you re in for a twisted ride i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere but from there the film settles down into a talk fest between two really damaged people daphne and buddy they re lonely mess up and boy do they talk about sex daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting some are quite funny mr chang some disturbing the harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what s going on or what daphne is really feeling and because i have a friend who used to escort i might add most seem quite real  you are alone is multi layered and mostly brilliant okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and i don t know that we d have missed anything  then again i need to see it again knowing the ending i like this movie the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them request granted	1
470	this film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness but it is a springboard for learning these people they  re life styles and pasts which support this the two lead actors bohl brundruge were in the moment as any two actors i have ever seen %100 believable they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly into their world the actors  seamless acting teamed with bechard s beautiful realistic dialog and her truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finalethis film is visual treat  soft increasing the intensity of the story the soundtrack serenades the viewer soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film i find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece intriguingintense	1
471	this was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to the script although written by gorman bechard seems as though it was written from a woman s point of view and at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one it is clear in this film that you are not alone	1
472	i am a film directors nightmare especially of the mega buck multiplex variety while not a student of the art i still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker s vision if i can find it that s why a gem such as  you are alone  is such an exhilarating find the intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go jessica bohl and richard brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director gorman bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people spoiler below i bought the dvd version and have shared it with several people the reactions have been varied from disbelief in the ability of daphne to complete the assignment for which buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating as a compulsively skeptical moviegoer i have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker this film took the later route for me and by the end i was so involved that i felt daphne s horror and pain at her role in buddy s demise my reaction to this film reminded me of watching  the cook the thief her wife and her lover  by peter greenaway many many years ago by the end i was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too i ve watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated i am familiar with other works she has been done including a couple of cheeky movies  galactic gigolo  and  attack of the killer bimbos  and a mixed bag  the kiss  which i recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn t really represent the directors vision too bad because i loved the prior two films and even found  the kiss  interesting but wish  the kiss  was available in a director s cut with all of the original vision and music in tact i look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads jessica bohl and richard brundage	1
473	you are alone is a beautiful almost delicate film smart directed crisply written with two complex and riveting performances and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you misread the story about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a $500 an hour schoolgirl escort and the depressed next door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown new haven hotel features breathtaking performances from both jessica bohl as the girl and richard brundage as her neighbor bohl as daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with maggie gyllenhaal in secretary she so captures a teenager s angst of growing into her own skin and when she talks about always being in control you start to realize she s not in control at all but in danger of going over the deep end which i guess in a way she does brundage as buddy is depressed angry heartbroken a shell of a man but it isn t until the film s startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of her pain after a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lovers and have the religious right running towards the exits we are brought into the hotel room at first you re not sure about these people or the film making style shaky annoyinglike the characters until you realize their back story told in short flashbacks they re confrontational at first for a reason and so is the camera but as they open up as the story settles down likewise so does the camera and i don t know 20 minutes in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screen having just seen the world premiere screening at the brooklyn film fest    where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes ¬ñ i almost wish the film were already on video so i could watch it again because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax i really thought things were going in a very different direction but i realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what i imagined i need to see it again but as dark and sexual as much of the talk is blunt to say the least i found myself laughing more than i might have expected at some of its candor which definitely falls into the things we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category it s very blunt especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if you re watching you are alone with a partner you ll definitely have something to talk about ¬ñ perhaps argue about ¬ñ afterwards perhaps it should come with a warning you should be alone when watching the music is amazing i would have come home and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if i could have the film looks as good as anything shot on film after the screening director gorman bechard was asked what sort of process she used to get the digital footage to look so good her answer none they couldn t afford it i have to give bechard credit i am a big fan of her two shorts the pretty girl and objects in the mirror but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this film to everyone involved bravo	1
474	some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens you are alone is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they re pain death is explored figuratively and literally it is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive too awake to reality it is the life not which you imagined behind the eyes of passer by s this film explores the aching pain in us all the frown beneath the cheery facade the ache below the ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all bechard the writer is a expert observer of the human condition and because of her non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand she as director focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they re playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation this is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman s experience together i have encountered as of yet even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounter the soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough it is each characters real voice sung through the beauty pain talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market the perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues   those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it i always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with mr bechard s both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it	1
475	i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you you are alone is that movie for me the film is constantly in my head and in my heart i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if i am seeing it for the first time there is nothing i did not like about the movie amazing soundtrack the ending was perfect very emotionally stirring it was compelling and riveting i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed i admired brittany s strength what a strong woman the tag line is when your darkest moments come to life we never know what we are capable of doing everyone says oh i would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art	1
476	the 1980 s  my dinner with andre  with wallace shawn and andre gregory is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit 2005 s  you are alone  demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul  the story revolves around three principal characters there s daphne a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life then there s the prostitute or paid escort britney as self confident as daphne is self conscious what makes them interesting is that they share the same body if not the same personae part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room she halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door ¬ñ but it is britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is opened on the other side of that door is buddy a middle aged nobody with few if any personal qualities that anyone would find attractive she goes so far as to be confrontational about britney s chosen profession as soon as she enters the room however we soon learn that buddy is daphne s next door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood this complicates things for the audience is buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does she want something else if it s sex that buddy wants here it is britney loves sex her definitions may be clintonesque but that doesn t lesson her enthusiasm she prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from each color band denotes a specific act that she ll perform ¬ñ but exactly which act isn t revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made  britney is or believes that she is in control of every encounter even when blindfolded and bound as she is by one of her regular clients she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie the film s imagery just keeps coming buddy s pathetic life is one of acceptance she s lost her wife her dog even her fantasies of the pretty teenager next door it s no coincidence that she s lured daphne or britney to this particular hotel room there s a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left this is a perfect metaphor for buddy s life all of the good parts are finished so it s here where she brought her wife when they were still college students that she makes her stand ¬ñ to regain some control of her own life to make her statement the director of  you are alone  gorman bechard knows her craft the principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film assisted by a myriad of inter cut scenes that add dimension to the characters their circumstances and conflicts as the film progresses britney asks buddy if she should get undressed she says yes but she strips only to her underwear an actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes one of the profession s five gets but it isn t buddy that s being teased we are as the film concludes we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play a tease doesn t work unless it actually delivers britney does so does  you are alone 	1
477	the actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast the quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there the screenplay is intense and does not wander the plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending we showed this film to a small group of patrons at gadsden s center for cultural arts after the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered while we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film i would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation	1
478	i caught this at the chicago indiefest and have to say you are alone is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think not ha ha wedding crashers  funny but sick twisted i can t believe she just said that but it s so damn true funny jessica bohl who deservedly won best actress is amazing to watch there s never a moment when you think oh i m watching a movie and she s an actress she s too damn real for words in fact there s 2 scenes that i m still giggling over and i won t give them away but in one she s in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is i almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing  in another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults and if it isn t the truest dialog i ve heard in a movie in a long time i don t know what is	1
479	jessica bohl plays daphne the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school daphne s neighbor is buddy richard brundage a depressed middle aged man still angry over loosing her wife daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness once buddy strips daphne of her secret she hires her to help her accept the loss of her wife the entire film takes place at the hotel duncan yet details of each character s history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks their appointment climaxes with the story s concluding twist both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance their on screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine the film s dialogue is natural real to life the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did her homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate daphne is intelligent yet clearly still an eighteen year old buddy may be middle aged but still not the hackneyed na√Øve type normally depicted in film daphne and buddy s conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life but is still comical at the right times although the general mood is very relaxed the dialogue has its own vivacity forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character s conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters even existing independently from the film the compilation truly expresses you are alone s central theme   loneliness you are alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken definitely worth seeing¬Ö it s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness	1
480	if you re tired by the same repetitive unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases you ll enjoy you are alone it is thought provoking well shot and riveting without revealing anything that you don t find out in the first few minutes of the movie this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor the vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where she hired her to come through their discussion you explore two shifting views of prostitution depression loneliness yet the movie is not depressing it talks about dark things without being depressing as a viewer your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around but gently you come out of it with a lot to think about i like that in a movie	1
481	if you want to see a brilliant performance of mikado played to perfection with expert timing and panache don t watch this version if you want to see a hammy version with eric idle strutting around in 1930 s english gentlemen s private club society this is the one to watch it s a lot of fun and a good intro to gilbert and sullivan but after this rush out and rent the canadian stratford version you ll see the difference between good and great nobody does g&s better than brian mcdonald and the stratford group	1
482	there are times i am convinced that the mikado is the best sullivan & gilbert opera ever but that is only so long as i m not listening to iolanthe be that as it may the mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the savoy operas yes i put the composer first nobody says hammerstein and rodgers or hart and rodgers or boito and verdi or what s her face and strauss you don t even hear the names of librettists for offenbach suppe or balfe gilbert was just the bigger name and the bigger ego at the time so they put her name first it s time that silly practice was put to rest anyway the mikado is a compleat s&g operetta it has some of sullivan s catchiest numbers combined with some of gilbert s cleverest lyrics it has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue it s got a wonderful degree of craziness and it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming this particular production filmed in a live performance in 1990 turns its imagination toward striking simplicity set in a british seaside resort toward the end of the art nouveau period it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely the result is costuming and setting in an eye caressing medley of whites grey and blacks accented by occasional bits of red and less frequent uses of yellow and green it takes some getting used to but it s really spiffy of course when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of japan you would be right to exclaim oh pooh bah did i just say that it s most gratifying that this fine production is now on dvd however one caveat the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy the tendency to superimpose images is alas annoying why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy fartsy stuff of that sort but it s the performance that counts the most we may skip the overture since although one is performed sullivan never wrote one true it may be so she wrote none for any of the savoys but the mikado overture doesn t even date from sullivan s lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others as for the rest of the operetta it s first rate and supremely funny the ko ko here is the estimable eric idle who does it credit there is a tradition of bringing a big name into the role the was a us tv production years ago in which ko ko was played by groucho marx with mixed results idle s performance is delightfully quirky  she does taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis racquet her i ve got a little list is done as a speech to a microphone    of course it has the usual updated lyrics which are much funnier than the usual run of such things and her delivery is positively hysterical it goes on that way throughout in this operetta it s important to have a good katisha it s just no fun if you re not being bellowed at in style this mikado has a fabulous katisha in felicity palmer in her way almost as big a name as idle she bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto  wonderful especially for a soprano and her costume not to mention her recital with franz liszt apparently accompanying nanki poo is played by bonaventura bottone i have trouble getting around is somewhat un nanki pooish chubby shortness    but is voice is undeniably a solid rich addition to the vocal palette there is a nice touch during a wand ring minstrel where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of her nancy on her knee    bear in mind the mikado s decree about flirting be that as it may bottone is a fine singing actor and if her appearance doesn t put the best face on nanki poo her performance does yum yum lesley garett and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly she and bottone do lovely duets pish tush mark richardson plays her persona as something a blageur and does it very well poo bah richard van allan is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water  a role later done to death in american sitcoms you know haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children    that sort of thing the mikado richard angas is bloody marvelous with an imperious voice at absolute variance with her ridiculous lyrics i don t recommend you get this as your only mikado get a good traditional production as well so you can see what gilbert intended more or less in terms of staging that being said i ll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once on the whole this is a terrific offering a vocal and visual delight with delicious over acting it s a dvd to treasure with dervish like maids tap dancing bellhops and all watch for the bellhops with signs	1
483	i first saw this on thames television and loved it i subsequently saw a dreadful write up by someone who certainly hadn t watched or listened to it so i bought a copy and then i bought another copy the only sad thing is that it is not available on pal vhs or region 2 dvd the australian version is great but this one is better i might buy another	1
484	i really enjoy this particular production of the mikado the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences    for instance as some day it may happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are ad libbed throughout the play liberties were also taken with the setting the costumes are not japanese but rather 1920s english although some of the tittipudlian girls wear  20s inspired kimonos this production is well choreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs if you re a gilbert & sullivan purist these changes may bother you but i think they re fine    and i love the costumes  felicity palmer katisha is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite add ons is when she first makes an entrance    the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics so she screeches at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main characters do a fine job as well i particularly like mark richardson as pish tush that toupee and lesley garrett as yum yum you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly there is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest if there is one draw back to this production it is that the stage makeup wasn t modified for close up shots with a camera foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner lipstick and blush everywhere i ve seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and it s a little jarring at first however i hope you ll get used to it and enjoy the mikado for what it s worth    a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic	1
485	cowboys and indians is an excellent film the writing acting directing could not have been better this was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed a film that can do that is a rare a special thing andrew berzins is an excellent writer and her talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film  thank you for telling this story ruby	1
486	i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it and eric is hotter than ever to often in the movies first nations people are seen as other than everyday people we are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people hey we are just like everyone else and this movie showed just that we hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice it is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that i cant wait till this comes out on dvd thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was	1
487	i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday there are good and bad in every race why make them all out to be bad that goes for all races today john harper was an educated man she graduated from high school she even had a year of university under her belt before going back to the reserve how do i know this john harper lived with my family for the 3 years she was in high school and she kept in contact with us the year after graduation she was a kind and gentle soul she could be fun loving and she could be serious when the times were right i wasn t very old when she left our house but i can still remember all the times she helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn t be bothered she even taught grade 3 the year before she came to winnipeg none of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as i m concerned what happened to john is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community not everyone in winnipeg think like the police do i knew the person inside and what she was like as a person not an indian	1
488	the real life case of an innocent first nations chiefthe indian by an winnipeg city officerthe cowboy is the basis of this tv movie the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada a small scale martin luther king thing the misjustice of first nations people is becoming a staple in the canadian cinema diet what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family s reactions the father played by gordon tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric schweig demands justice the stars gordon tootoosis and adam beachwindtalkers skinwalkershave minor almost cameo appearances soon to be star eric schweig makes her mark in this film with a powerful performance an honourable mention goes to veteran actor gary chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to her credit her portrayal of the troubled soul inspector dowson was worthy of a gemini awardthe canadian emmyalong with eric schweig the special effectsjump cuts dream sequences are occasional and not overbearing couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil stonechild case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience	1
489	blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action i cant wait for blade 2 this is one of wesley snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great	1
490	okay sure this movie is a bit on the hokey side it s difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility dolph lundgren as the punisher anyone but this tries very hard i ve never read the actual comic book but that doesn t really matter i suppose i judge a film mainly on its merits not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else s idea unless its a film based on a true story that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy so why will i give this movie a fairly high rating because it tries it tries very hard in my book that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus it seems everybody has their take on vampire lore be it the cross the silver the garlic the aversion to sunlight whatever some of those ideas are included here the storyline is familiar a group of vampires conspire to take over the world with one person mainly standing in their way blade wesley snipes lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses who have slowly but surely moved into the world and share it with humankind for the most part the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them the vampires have even taken familiars people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires  dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned now that i think of it there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the roddy piper film they live a hidden enemy hidden group of people plotting against them the fight to save human kind all that is present in blade as well the acting isn t the best here snipes is at best only slightly better than some of her other roles n bushe wright a relative newcomer isn t too bad kris kristofferson is forgettable as blade s sidekick she s to blade what chip is to the punisher stephen dorff does the best job of the whole cast here as the head vampire you just love to hate i don t know but i just loved the special effects in this film from the blood soaked vampire style rave all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film the special effects aren t half bad there s certainly enough blood and gore to go around but after all this is a vampire movie right the various shapes and sorts of weaponry blade uses are fairly unique and not generally used in contemporary action films snipes has more flair with a decked out sword than she does with say a machine gun plus there s so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away unless of course you are indiana jones overall this isn t the best action film ever made but it s not half bad either as a bonus the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool too tell me in what other movies can you hear super drum n bass like source direct or photek my rating 8 10	1
491	hi blade is an sensational action movie  the hero wesley snipes and the villain have done justice to their roles the movie s action sequences are better then matrix  wesley snipes is one the best action heroes ever if u like action vampire movies  this is the one the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made beforebut these is the best of them enjoy the ride	1
492	it s got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie and it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today wesley snipesso all in all this movie hasn t left anything out and that s my comment of what i think is a classic beat em up movie	1
493	not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series i expected this film to merely accomplish the basic introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics present a plot and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel and that s exactly what this movie happens to deliver however unlike with most other comic book movies i felt that this one did it with a bit of class risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes blade presents a very modern believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread  as minor as it may have been  from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional ie sappy aspect is concerned yes the movie has innumerable plotholes and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years but when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this what else matters it may run a little long but for what it sets out to do blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre	1
494	in this film i prefer deacon frost she s so sexy i love her glacial eyes i like stephen dorff and the vampires so i went to see it i hope to see a gothic film with her blade it was very about the future if vampires had been real i would be turned by frost	1
495	blade is probably one of the best vampire action movies ever madeit has it allactionhorrorbloodthis movie is for action fansit s either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you don t like action or vampires movieswesley snipes takes her role seriously and she her the perfect guy for blade	1
496	great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful the girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness	1
497	i loved it in fact i watched it over and over and over and i could watch it again this movie doesn t get boring the vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie it s a job well done great for today s generation wesley snipes was born for this role stephen dorff was an ideal vampire arly jover mmmm mmm she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has donal logue provides great comical relief this vampire movie is like no other i can t wait for blade 2	1
498	this film was brilliant i absolutely loved it wesley snipes was great for this role   and i m sure blade 2 would be just as good blade is by far one of my favorite action horror movies out there and if you havent seen it yet and like vampires and blood all that stuff you should really rent it because i assure you that you ll love it	1
499	i remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that i vowed to buy the video when it came out  while i won t go too far into dissecting this film i will say that i gave it an 8 10 for all the reasons you can read in the other user s reviews what i will say is this  the first 10 minutes of this film are incredible it s as close to a textbook audience grabber as i ve ever seen i once put this movie on at a party where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave i just wanted to see what would happen if i showed them the first ten minutes everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end	1
500	this is one of those movies that i can watch again and again and not get tired of it it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever i liked this one even more than x men in fact this movie is sort of a cross between x men and the matrix and it came out before either wesley snipes does a great job with the character of blade she is just not an emotionless super hero also this movie isn t sugercoated to get a pg 13 rating sure comic books are for kids mainly but i like a little more in my movies let s face it if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic this comic book adaptation also has something that many don t a good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy let s face it none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight	1
501	this film is superb wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class she kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud the movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as she runs around wiping out all suck heads the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too wesley should have done more action films than she has i know she is a very good actor and in this she is not streched as much as in her more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go she is the best actor of them all only bruce willis stallone and perhaps tom cruise if she counts as an action star come close also aswell as wesley being quality steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing but she does overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace	1
502	interesting twist on the vampire yarn   fast loud and moody despite my initial fears kris k carries her part reasonably well and snipes aka blade provides a formidable physical presence lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable  110 minute distraction if you like the black look of the matrix then blade will appeal to you blade even has a  dodge the bullets  sequence	1
503	for a brief moment the opening scene with traci lords and the techno bar is incredible i d probably follow her to my ultimate death too best vampire movie of all time but with a twist the fight scenes are awesome wesley snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day and stephen dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving herself up the hierarchy by any means necessary great flick 9 10 where s blade ii	1
504	however closely the movie is to the comics it doesn t matter this movie radically moves away from the boredom of interview with the vampire although it s acting was good and slides in the wonderful action scenes very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all disadvantage   poor graphics does it matter nope	1
505	in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations blade is by far one of the best realised and most faithful overall to the source material given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since her debut as a back up figure in marvel s tomb of dracula the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the comic s history while changes were inevitably made the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms don t let any of you friends tell you different blade is one fine film if it feels too comic booky for you stanley kubrick snobs out there it s because it s supposed to deal with it but don t dis it for it	1
506	blade is a dark gloomy but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones a bit of gore but nothing really that bad wesley snipes played a strong role as she eliminates the vampires not really like buffy because thats too tame but blade delivers a decent plot and it s the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy nightthats at best viewing 87%	1
507	overall i give this film a decent 76 to start i ll say i love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen if you read comics occasionally or simply watch dvd extras you ll see the blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film among the changes blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore acquiring all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses the credit for this goes obviously to david goyer a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books thanks to her blade has become a much more interesting character and i find her one of my favorite anti heroes really wesley snipes is born to play this role although some would ve probably pererred dezenel washington or will smith lol her acting here doesn t need to be exactly oscar winning per say considering the character but i m glad she decids to play the daywalker in the two sequels also starring is stephen dorff as our main villain and kris kristofferson as blade s alfred so to speak the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure the opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts i ve got to say as much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like spider man or x men stephen norrington had the villains portrayed in a way i didn t like so much honestly their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn t really feel like a comic book film to me plus la magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it i guess not to mention a sense of extra non realism a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kindawelldumb moving away from a few of its flaws the music by mark isham was great and fitted the film nicely luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel blade 2	1
508	 blade  would be an extremely above average comic book vampire hunter action horror if it weren t for two minor flaws #1 i loved seeing the all but invincible blade snipes do her slicing and dicing but the whole yes fist punch was literally a letdown #2 bad no make that horrible cgi ¬ñ even for 1998 standards this is mainly in the last third but some sprinkled throughout okay despite those minor infractions i really enjoyed this movie all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another  matrix  rip off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior so maybe  the matrix  copied  blade  at any rate it s a very movie for multiple genre loving audiences comic book geeks action fanatics and horror vampire lovers so we have blade half man half vampire or day walker and her accomplish whisler a la batman and alfred battling the undead who apparently almost out number humans who knew in a rare act of humanity blade s more of an antihero our sword ninja vamp rescues a newly infected coincidentally blood specialist doctor meanwhile trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants you guessed it supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it it s not the most original concept if you read what i just wrote but still highly enjoyable you will want to see blade succeed you will root for her despite her imperfections and mannerisms and you will know what s coming as this is the typical act 1 2 3 of a comic book introduction movie still watch this without trying to go too deep such as vampire spf 1000 suntan lotion really what about the scalp wouldn t that still burn just like the money they burn for weapons uh okay i am going too deep once again sit back and enjoy the techno charged fun ride	1
509	hope the summary line won t irritate you that much it s a little homage to the chappelle show charlie murphy but also to the character daywalker but i ll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn t like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read  let s start with the good things the quote strong bloody violence which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well this is not a movie for kids or for the faint of hearted it has blade as a central character wesley snipes is phenomenal and a crazy enough story thread to hold justify the action scenes the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent the action scenes are great here too ok over to the things i didn t like the overall story is too thin it s enough as i ve written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more and a character like blade deserves more imo the drama therefor isn t the best  also it s use of clich√©s doesn t help some characters are underwritten  that s that o	1
510	i admit i go more for the traditional vampire tale but this one is a real winner lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours there was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world a good one for all us vampire lovers	1
511	it seems to me that a lot of people don t know that blade is actually a superhero movie on par with x men daredevil punisher and the likes what all these heroes and in the case of x men hero group have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of marvel blade was originally a normal person in a blue outfit who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with dracula herself and she was for lack of a better word boring so boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the marvel universe at least until she was reinvented david goyer did a stroke of genius when she took the character of blade and turned her into a leather clad dark knight she can t take all the credit though and much of this must go to stephen norrington as well who with her distinct visual style brings out the best of the character the blade character wesley snipes is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with batman like darkness snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character she is however a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels kris kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of whistler to life with energy and sense of timing n bushe wright however is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless donal logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character german udo kier should also be mentioned as she brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race probably born of her experiences from playing dracula stephen dorf provides the best acting in the film and her chilling performance as deacon frost stands as one of the best screen villains i have perhaps ever seen the story is good and i feel renews the vampire genre something that hasn t been done since robert rodrigues  from dusk till dawn by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel by saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic far from it a lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible including the effects which are pretty good for their time i found the vampire dustings to be a very nice touch in stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com bust which looks great the fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face as previously stated norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets her apart from the directors of the following blade movies del toro is nearly as skilled but i prefer norrington s style her style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere a very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie all in all blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie suffice to say many of them are located near the ending of the film does that the film must settle with a high 7 7 10	1
512	wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade a half human half vampire known the daywalker she has all their strengths and her only weakness is the thirst for blood since she teamed up with whistler kris kristofferson she has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries but omnipotent overlord deacon frost stephen dorff is tired of living in harmony with the humans food as she calls them and she plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world this movie is well cast written and directed ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely delivers 8 10	1
513	if you like horror or action watch this film asap if the opening scene doesn t get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse great action excellent casting and top one liners this is the only film i have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop kick & punch thrown not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun its a pure rush of dark comic book action 9 10	1
514	blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and wesley snipes delivers what i would say to be her best performance yet this film has everything that you would ask for in an action thriller it has plenty of blood guts and gore a twisted disturbed bad buy moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects wesley snipes fighting movement is fantastic this film is in my opinion a must see wesley snipes cool solid appearance makes this film and i can t wait for the sequel  blade 2  being released next year my imdb rating   9 out of 10	1
515	now here is a movie that does something that hasn t been done in a long time it take ten or so different elements that we re already familiar with vampires martial arts a techno beat top o the line special effects etc and turns it into something that feels brand new in what could have easily been merely a combination of mortal kombat and buffy the vampire slayer wesley snipes no favorite of mine since and mostly because of passenger 57 gives a really good turn as the half human  half bloodsucker she acknowledges the internal conflict but doesn t dwell on it more than necessary she makes blade as deep a character as michael keaton made batman i ll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy on the other hand you sort of have to have that in a movie like this so it s easily excusable well snipes is good and steven dorff hyped in the previews makes a more than bad enough bad guy to snipes  hero she s got class presence and enough control in her little pinky to teach al pacino how to tone it down a bit who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor i sincerely hope this is and whoa where the heck did kris kristofferson get acting talent don t get me wrong but the prolific actor hasn t done anything memorable since millennium and how many of us watched that just  cause of the cool video box well here she is folks in a very obi wanish turn as blade s mentor and father figure and good job too the quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects accompanied by a pulsing techno beat the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of mortal kombat hey it had a script too i was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there the two major indications to me that i saw a quality flick were these i had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in a la any schumacher batman the avengers mk annihilation godzilla or armageddon wow how many of those came out this year ugh also i look forward to the inevitable sequel as per the film s ending let s just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one 	1
516	i didn t see this movie until it appeared on television because i was doubtful about comic flicks ever since the batman series spawn judge dredd and many other pitiful pg 13 bombs i dodged everything at all cost i would question in my mind why can t someone make a movie that is rated r and stays true to the story how difficult is that and finally my prayers have been answered with blade this movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed but not blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment blade ii is cool but not as cool as the first blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks i ve seen in a long time	1
517	i must confess that i ve been a huge fan of the almighty david the hoff hasselhoff ever since she starred in the hit 80 s tv series knight rider whether it s her extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy revenge of the cheerleaders or her brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci fi gem starcrash the hoff has proved time and time again that she s a simply terrific and shamefully underrated actor supreme the hoff excels here as gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with her repressed virginal writer girlfriend leslie attractive brunette leslie cummings investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of massachussetts they re doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotel s last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts a bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious lady in black an effectively eerie hildegard knef granted the rest of the cast gives the hoff a run for her money the ever perky linda blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed natch legendary jazz singer annie ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat poor annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and she s hung upside down in a chimney and gorgeous blonde catherine hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut fabrizio laurenti s competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere gianlorenzo battaglia s slick glossy cinematography the fluid prowling steadicam tracking shots are especially nice the gaudy special effects carlo maria cordio and randy miller s spirited shuddery n spooky score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par but ultimately it s the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky italian horror cheese such a winner she takes her shirt off once hubba hubba gets sprayed with blood and    warning major *spoiler* ahead    even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end produced by none other than joe d amato this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun	1

519	witchery is a decent little euro trash horror yarn david hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly she s one of the better actors linda blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays hoff s wifeshe is hilariously bad the plot of this film is ridiculous too it s got some holes which you can t help but notice but it remains entertaining throughout the gore in witchery is freaking outstanding i loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast and the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the devil was pretty damned disturbing i d say this one is a must for gorehounds if you re looking for an overproduced well acted flick look elsewhere but if you like old school style italian sleaze and over the top gore witchery belongs on your shelf i m surprised by the low rating on here what were you people expecting the exorcist 7 out of 10 kids	1
520	linda blair has been acting for forty years now and while she will never escape the part of regan macneil in the exorcist few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as witchery does she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase they are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents catherine hickland and rick farnsworth and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer david hasselhoff and her writer girlfriend leslie cumming who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch hildegard knef it seems that a long ago witch hunt resulted in her suicide and she was with child at the time unaware of the danger jane has recently dreamt of the witch s dramatic death and jane s little brother tommy michael manchester has been more directly visited by her spooky black clad spirit which she calls  the lady in black  the group s time at the island inn begins quietly enough unknown to them however the lady in black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat george stevens before long the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the lady in black begins her reign of terror she plans to avenge her own fate by possessing jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse   greed lust and the blood of a virgin as the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild she haunts them one by one in gruesome horrifying ways the island location is effectively scary and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot it s such a colorful film that it reminds me of dario argento s work the lighting is excellent and the set decoration is perfectly spooky the soundtrack is very effective and unique the horror effects are extreme terrifying and unforgettable the cinematography is great and it is this that brings us back to linda blair the creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot lots of dramatic push ins lingering close ups that subtly detail jane s incremental possession and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films there are hidden homages to rosemary s baby jacob s ladder the shining black sunday and of course the exorcist she does a great job and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance that isn t to say that the rest of the cast disappoints catherine hickland is sexy and very good and veteran performer annie ross is memorable as jane s bitchy mother rose hasselhoff gives it her best but she is not essentially a film star and her television persona gets in the way of her performance blair and young michael manchester have a wonderful chemistry together the film is otherwise so violent and creepy in a good way that it desperately needs their warmth blair also played a mother in 2003 s monster makers and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them lastly hildegard knef in one of her last roles plays a great witch and she has the most amazing voice and accent along with blair she was also perfectly cast but it s blair s movie all the way jane brooks also seems to have some psychic ability and this aspect of the film hearkens back to exorcist ii the heretic i think witchery is up there with the exorcist exorcist ii hell night and summer of fear as blair s best genre work to date	1
521	witchery or witchcraft as it s commonly known in europe beings with jane brooks linda blair waking up from a nightmare involving a witch jane s mother & father rose annie ross & freddie robert champagne are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from boston renovating it & reopening it together with jane & their young son tommy michael manchester rose & freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named linda sullivan catherine hickland to check on the amount of work that needs doing they also meet up with the estate agent jerry giordano rick farnsworth & hire a local fisherman named sam george stevens to take them to the island once there they enter the hotel & begin to inspect the property while back on the boat sam is killed & the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance they discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named gary david hasselhoff & her virgin fianc√© leslie leslie cumming who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends & superstitions surrounding the infamous island & hotel as the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious  lady in black  hildegard knef keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession human sacrifice & satanic rites the director of this american italian co produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the imdb lists fabrizio laurenti as martin newlin but there are rumours that joe d amato did the honours either way to be honest despite it s bad reputation i found witchery quite entertaining in a so bad it s good cheesy sort of way the script credited to harry spalding & daniele stroppa on the imdb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is daniel davis anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job please stop laughing at heart it s a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything the different sets of characters have reasonable motives & didn t get on my nerves as much as i d thought they might it s not plotted very well it doesn t make a whole a lot of sense & the dialogue isn t exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole witchery entertained me for it s 95 odd minute duration plain & simple it s reasonably well paced a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal bizarre goings on & gruesome deaths to keep one amused one part of witchery which destroys some of it s credibility is this so called storm there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim in witchery s supposed  twist  ending didn t really work for me either & just check out the dumb expression on cummings face on that final freeze frame the hotel provides for a good isolated location & adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable  horror  feel throughout cheap horror at that technically witchery is not too bad at all it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout & while not exactly the pinnacle of film making finesse it s overall production values are slightly better than expected the violence & gore is of typical euro explicitness a woman has her lips sewn shut & hung inside a fireplace so she can t scream as the others light it someone is crucified & then burned alive impaled on a swordfish someones veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips witchery was shot in english so there is no dubbing as far as acting goes david hasselhoff & linda blair in the same film what more can i say yes ladies hasselhoff does take her shirt off & for the lads cummings takes hers off both hasselhoff & blair are a hoot to watch in this thing however the little kid is very annoying & really can t act at all i sure most sane film goers will disagree with my opinions but i still stand by the fact that i liked it & would happily watch it again witchery is pretty good fun & definitely worth a watch if your into  bad  films or your a horror fan in general	1
522	i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual horror movie again i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the exorcist movies which i loved what was up with all of those nasty b movies she did  david hassellhoff on the other hand all i could do is laugh she is not cut out to be a horror movie actor david needs to stick to knight rider or baywatch all around this is an awesome movie even for the eighties this was an awesome film it has horror action and drama it is a suspenseful and i loved the way linda blair turned out	1
523	during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it something like is killingg√§nget now taking off nazism so my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of nazism when recently seeing this movie in the tv version i had this filter before me and it wasn t difficult to see this strangely enough i haven t met this way of interpreting the film ever since i first heard it these are the things i found in four shades of brown in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster 1 the crematory worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them in the crematory room in dealing with death and fire it s almost like a cheerful game to her the seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and her boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures her father severely possible lesson the importance of showing the young adequate emotions when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good 2the magician maneuvers her wife like an invisible puppeteer just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy she pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair their son has tried to revolt in creating her own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to her parents bad taste the real problem she is carrying within is far from comprehensible to her her fathers behavior passes on when suffocating her own wife in her spotless environment possible lesson oppression breeds bondage 3the father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to her children when she cheats them on their inheritance she robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance possible lesson when no love given you cannot give any 4the fathers abuse of her daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression here the ice cold nazi sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scin head nazists behavior when oppressing others  possible lesson  can nazism take birth in a pervert home can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic nazism  very seldom does a movie contains so much it reveals little by little as i meditate on it i consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb especially the nice seeming bloke played by ulf brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all	1
524	this movie must be exported to the rest of the world an absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden the one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended  also the unique pause in the middle is something i ve never seen before can t wait for the series if they re doing one or the extended dvd apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 35 hours	1
525	i didn t know what to expect from this hugely popular and hilarious swedish comedy & satire team as they released their first feature film more broad satire well we do get four contemporary exceptionally memorable tales of family pains generation gaps and fatherhood in particular but it s drama thankfully and what drama epic in its scope as each episode is from carefully picked geographically different parts of sweden but each story could seriously carry a whole movie if expanded separately it s dark twisted harrowing yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed script acting and cinematography are absolute world class as three hours seem to get by in a blink it s four shades of mastery and easily one of the best films in the nations  cinema history it s sweden s answer to short cuts or magnolia if you like and instantly on par with those 9 out of 10 from ozjeppe	1
526	never ever have i been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people that faces a crisis or many in some ways a little like short cuts but totally different at the same time there are a heap of lead characters whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold and they are as persons show their good and their bad sides their weaknesses and their strengths with lots of drama and laughter the closest equivalent in a us movie i can think of which then is far weaker in every respect is the royal tenenbaums  four shades of brown as the title would be in english tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and her wife and her elderly parents who are traveling magicians about the receptionist at an animal crematory and her family misadventures about the members of a cooking course who mostly talk about their sorry lives and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave by singing and appearing in 3d during the funeral thanks to high tech equipment that has cost her entire fortune the family gets nil not even the famous horse is given to the family there is a warmth and compassion in this film that is filled with grief and laughter that i ve never experienced before most actors were new to me except robert gustafsson and one or two more but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the swedish guldbagge extravaganza = the swedish oscar awards a week ago male female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film plus a few more to boot if you have the chance go and see it   the hours float by very quickly	1
527	this movie is about london and it s an amazing movie it will be released on dvd in april 2003 and i will buy it when it gets out so if you have not seen it until then buy it the music in the movie is even better saint etienne have done the soundtrack	1
528	being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the vancouver international film festival this movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a  not so well known  london the movie is held completely in  dark  colours which i personally don t like too much furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat other than that there are some great comments by londoners and excellent shots finisterre doesn t glorify london by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the  special little retreats  for londoners all in all +great soundtrack +nice shots +great insights  narration  tiering to watch at times  very dark picture worth watching i give it a 7 10	1
529	i absolutely loved this movie since i don t want to give much away it s basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together it s very heartwarming story between the struggles they have i also think natalie and susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film this is definitely worth seeing two thumbs up way up	1
530	i just saw this movie tonight coming into it i thought it would be good because i like natalie portman alot and susan sarandon is a great actor too but it was way better than i could have imagined you come out of the movie feeling great the acting was excellent which is something that can be hard to come by lately natalie portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at nyu think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor anyways back on subject the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and i definitely think that everyone should go see it i would give more details but i don t want to give away the movie	1
531	i just came back from seeing this awesome movie i can relate to it so muchit reminded me when my sister had to go to college we had to move from place to place and my mom acts like adele august boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes one of the best real life movies i ve ever seen and natalie portman rules 10 10	1
532	i m sorry but star wars episode 1 did not do any justice to natalie portman s talent and undeniable cuteness she was entirely underused as queen amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible for anywhere but here she sheds her god awful makeup and she acts normally and not only can she act good she looks good doing it i m a bit older than she she s only 18 and i have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to portman i ve been a watcher of portman s since beautiful girls where she was younger but just as cute there s big things for her in the future   i can see it	1
533	adam sandler s movies are my favorite comedies the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie the matrix is my favorite sci fi movie anywhere but here is my favorite drama perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it s acting susan sarandon is absolutely amazing by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself she did a simply amazing job natalie portman also did a great job i recently rented her first movie leon 1994 in which she played a 12 year old girl i believe that she is a contradiction in terms she was a good kid actress well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress in fact she s much better not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together i mean even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie this movie is about a 14 year old girl portman and her restless mother sarandon that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years usually down might i add although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be summarized vaguely but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strong and it is very strong but also the plot sequencing is great and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as classic i loved this movie i laughed i cried and although admittedly there are a few loopholes it s still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end	1
534	being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly i related to the character ann august more than most would my mother isnt as eccentric as adele but the feelings of lonliness is the same this movie is perfect in the ating aspects and natalie s and susan s performances are so linked together that it s the best onscreen dual i have seen in years their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be anywhere but here including me and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother its the tears that blend everyone around you together more	1
535	its the best movie i have seen in 2000 it has the beautiful and talented natalie portman in it it has a great storyline cast and soundtrack i enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10	1
536	since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother susan s character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some guy she s in outside providence but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i haven t seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me a good film 7 10	1
537	most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by natalie portman and susan sarandon natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in america and one worthy of a golden globe nomination the control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism any natalie fan would ve seen the film based on her past successes but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film it is a truly humbling experience	1
538	susan sarandon she made this movie for me i ve never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were adele august i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who s truly believable  natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral i gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from me because of her performance as far as relationship movies go beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but i highly recommend it	1
539	it¬¥s a movie to see on tv and only once i mean it¬¥s good but it¬¥s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well known it isn¬¥t very original but it isn¬¥t boring the best thing of the movie are the performances natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job i give it a 7	1
540	i was laying in bed flicking through the channels and boy do i have channels 500 of them with over 70 movie channels i probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month dvd has spolied me anyway i m flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see natilie portman i take interest 110 minutes later i am still interested how could this be when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it i never thought i d watch it nevermind like it the story is based on a book and you can tell the movie is very episodic andit s not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in may be its that performances that do it i m pretty sure in must have been this movie was good for no reason peter s movie rating out of 10 7	1
541	i was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script susan sarandon plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together she removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in hollywood the daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice    the bond with mother is pathologically strong in time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground she sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves  em and leaves  em she sees that the mother doesn t get it so how can she look to her mother for guidance the mother directs the girl to a drama try out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly by night mother this causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic but the lesson takes hold there is character growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go it is a touching scene and a valuable lesson that parents however emotionally dependent have to let the child go and become her own separate person	1
542	anywhere but here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural wisconsin to sunny beverly hills california in search of a better life the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in wisconsin with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother  spoilers while it s true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new anywhere but here doesn t cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on natalie portman s face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about natalie s mother pressing her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from shawn hatosy as one of natalie s very close cousins from back home her death is a tragic clich√© almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this not great but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look	1
543	chick flick of course been done before many times predictable yes worth watching you bet i was delighted with sarandon and portman s portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line i am a great fan of mother daughter stories what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development although this is not the best of its genre i will buy it and watch it again i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior	1
544	regarded as another one of the recent over the top drama s brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many mother daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two actress  talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliche s and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over the top drama s	1
545	i thought anywhere but here was a good movieit stars two wonderful actresses susan sarandon and natlie portman which when i heard they were in a movie together i resist watching itoverall it was a pretty enjoyable movieit had it s moments where i felt as if they tried to hard and there was also some really overdone and worn out material but there wasn t anything in the movie that i absolutely hatedi even liked how they used the pop up performance of the uncredited thora birch and all the little happy sad moments are touching and effectiveif you want to watch this movie go ahead because even though i don t recommend it it s not something you should avoid and a 59 rating seems unfair in my opinion	1
546	this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils anywhere but here is an engaging film from beginning to the end both ann and adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in anywhere but here she is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once i have always liked susan sarandon and i think she is grossly underrated anywhere but here is a captivating emotional journey	1
547	the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much appreciated emotional depth susan sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script i am not saying the script was bad in any way i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times i don t think it was the script writer s fault the film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes the film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances all in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 7 10 bethany cox	1
548	anne natalie portman tells us about how much she hates her mother adele susane sarandon that s how the movie begins adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to california without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason the story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter it s really deep and touching thanks to the great work of the actresses natalie was nominated to a golden globe for that role she is one of the most talented actresses i ever saw and so is sarandon they really look like mother daughter the soundtrack is also great the movie is incredible *10 out of 10*	1
549	i was able to see anywhere but here last night as a free sneak preview i absolutely loved the film i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother daughter relationshipthere was definitely a connection between adele a and ann i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role portman was also excellent as ann she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don t think any other teenage actress could i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the actress and supporting actress categories it would be a shame if they were overlooked	1
550	my one line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true i did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too much adele who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon did not come off as a very likable character she is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail adele s daughter anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother s shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14 17 years old this of course makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14  17 years old either portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years yet even with the two solid leads wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as she did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke though i have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight	1
551	natile portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes as the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman s portrayal of the daughter the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot who changes this film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also the hallmark of fine drama	1
552	being a freshman in college this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom of course my situation doesn t parrallel with natalie portman and surandon s situation but my mom and i have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights there is always the mother telling you what to do or not being the kind of mother you want to be i was balling my eyes at the end of this movie surandon s reaction of her daughter going to the east coast miles away after all they ve been through reminded me of how i felt being from a small city in the west coast going to new york  the movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up it is very touching i was moved by the movie every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real you didn t get any phony sentimentality i was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie alone wishing my mother was sitting next to me so i could hug her and thank her for everything this movie is a bit corny of course but everything is trully momentous its all about what a mom can learn from her child and what a child learns from her mother 8 10	1
553	the interaction between portman and sarandon was quite interesting and i was really sold on the mother daughter relationship it is a family story that isn t dulled down by frills and special effects a story of how it really is i couldn t help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends the acting was quite exquisite and i hope we ll be seeing both portman and sarandon in familiar roles down the road	1
554	well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother daughter relationship film  beautiful film	1
555	this film was a new direction for natalie portman a much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself annportman and susan sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman s character grows up unknowingly at first to adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for it ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behind the acting is top notch from both of them they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie though this movie really doesn t take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isn t too flawed let s me recommend it i will say however it will probably go away soon i don t believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses	1
556	susan sarandon and natalie portman play adele and ann august a single mother who s the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn pragmatic daughter adele wanting to make a fresh start in a big city moves them from wisconsin to california decent if not exceptional or particularly memorable with some serious and sad moments it pushes some emotional buttons that s for sure best thing it offers is a solid cast and sarandon and portman are quite good in the leads   even if their characters are one dimensional at times could be better could be worse i gave this one seven out of ten	1
557	wayne wang s direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than slums of beverly hills which covers remarkably similar ground the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting real chemistry there this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration susan sarandon s character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic and natalie portman deflects each attack on her character s ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha lyonne character in slums of beverly hills portman s character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained	1
558	a must see documentary     this movie had so many things to consider while watching it it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named brenton butler she accused of killing a white tourist in florida it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed her wife the husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing the police little to investigate the crime brenton s lawyer patrick mcguinness is meticulous in getting information to help her client she tells the viewers what she thinks and the strategy she will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against her young client to get her to confess the camera goes with mcguinness to where brenton was questioned mcguinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored she questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard brenton say to one of the investigators and she challenges their own words mcguinness investigates with ann finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not the movie shows the butlers as a loving christian family who have faith in their son s innocence and faith that god will set brenton free they visit her in jail and pray with her there to encourage her there are scenes of group prayer for brenton the lawyers the judge and everyone involved in this case i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the judicial system including judges police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it	1
559	i saw this movie last night on hbo & didn t expect to get hooked   i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo but it happened & you will too it s a tragic documentary 2002 oscar winner about a murder of an elderly female tourist in jacksonville florida and subsequent investigation arrest & trial of a 15 year old boy watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society this film was most deserving of an esteemed oscar   you ll be moved to tears	1
560	this is an extraordinary film as a courtroom drama it s compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it s frightening for brenton butler the consequences of this system could be devastating this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it s not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court in truth the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty or a guilty man being free every citizen has a right to justice whether a perpetrator or a victim but do they get it the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i ve seen	1
561	art imitates life imitates art atticus finch is reincarnated into the da in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who done it and how did it happen the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again the music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience	1
562	anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or csi would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case a murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15 year old boy off the street and take her to the only witness   a 65 year old man   and say is this the guy who did it sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that she looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently she must have shrunk reversed her age by 5 10 years and changed clothes the police made absolutely no effort   and they admitted it the did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15 year old the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville florida let everyone now start talking about southern justice	1
563	very good film very good documentary very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted narcissistic heartless swines their one eyed parents community and environment raised them as i tip my lid to pat mcguinness can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation we need her integrity endurance intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business all the animals come out at night   whores skunk pussies buggers queens fairies dopers junkies sick venal someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets pat mcguinness should be the first drops of that real rain the people who control this earth are animals they need to be drowned i m just in shock walking the night is scary business the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives in murder on a sunday morning in pat mcguinness  blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning it is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the punters play a rigged game to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are how does it feel you railroading abominable snaky fingers of the law how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution your rigged confession your rigged detective work found out for what it really was how does it feel  i hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed nothings	1
564	you think the police are always right you believe that eye witnesses are always right you believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation you believe a us city might have a few bad apples in law enforcement but that the good cops will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil for evil s sake in the bud you believe that the possibility of an ex football lineman being instated as a detective solely because her dad is the county sheriff and being allowed to beat confessions out of randomly selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to herself could happen in the america of the 1930s but not today you believe a judge will not send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer by nabbed by the police because it was hot and they did not feel like working that day you believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule and an injustice like this could never involve your family member someone in the middle class or someone like you you think that you are aware of every terrible indisputable 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in america  yet you haven t seen this film	1
565	i watched this on hbo because it won the oscar a week earlier it compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas the story is of a 15 year old black kid placed on trial for the jacksonville fl murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim s husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced about half the footage is of the trial it s supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers two public defenders explaining their case interviewing witnesses and visiting key locations this is edited with a minimum of needless repetition and placed in logical order the camera work is pretty solid and there s a mildly surprising epilogue	1
566	with that carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess lying deception laziness the list goes on however as an american i was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today s police force as is reflected with the duval county sheriff department s horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15 year old accused black youth i shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man s life hung in the crooked balance of justice however there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly paid public defenders stuck by their guns irony intended and forced the truth from the detectives i wanted to fly down to florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in duval county those lawyers care about the little man and most importantly for justice the other story line is about faith and family praises to the accused s family and their strong christian submit any dedicated religion beliefs and wonderful family values i hope they win their lawsuit against the duval county sheriff s department bravo for justice bravo for the little guy	1
567	i watched this movie with my mother she is 81 yrsold and was raised to be a bigot she even acknowledges this i don t think she really understood what was happening she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty scary i felt for this child and her family what torture they went through and remained faithful that is true faith back to the movie i was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude i am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case it was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to her i could tell when one the cops was lying she would not look the defender in the eyes her eyes moved to the side when she answered the questions it is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of her skin i read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men they were finally found guilty after many years i can t remember the title but it was the same premise whites doing whatever they want with blacks i am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time if not forever i pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white no comment from her i want to commend the director and producer of this film i feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project i am an avid viewer of indy films i feel that they are well written and have substance i am pleased that i happened to grab this movie on the shelf i felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly i feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society	1
568	i just saw the movie through netflix i was intrigued by the way the movie was described but in the end it was better i was moved in many different directions while watching this movie i was filled with hurt hate angry bitternesspain and finally relief to look at the young man accused would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person the smugness of the police makes you cring because just as the rodney king beating brought to light the brutality of the police this movie brings forth the total lack of moral fiber in these police and the fact that they beat this boy and got away with it only infuriates you more but i have to tell you i fell in love with the attorney mc guinness one of my favorite lines when she was telling us what an a**hole on of the cops was the cop told her to go on keep sucking on that cancer stick mc guinness told the cop  i always have a cigarette before sex  i was letting her know i was going to screw her i have a new respect for some of the law in this country	1
569	this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in florida and the subsiquent court case that follows what this film shows is how corrupt the american police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if she rots in jail because i said she was the man who murdered my wifethe star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only her job in court but she also did she what the police should have done all along fascinating stuff 7 out of 10	1
570	i happened to leave hbo on last night following six feet under what ran next has left me speechless what an incredible piece of work i don t just recommend this i mandate that you see this it s better than anything hollywood could ever ruin i just hope they never get their hands on it	1
571	i don t need to say much about how good this documentary is  it s truly an amazing piece of true narrative the story is simple enough a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in florida and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and her family on her side it s very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all her human ways  you can t help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true story it s a shame more people haven t seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it for those interested in race relations in the united states and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process it s well worth your time and effort to find this documentary i give it a 10	1
572	you know before seeing this film i had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases i mean if they were arrested and charged they must have been guilty i reasoned i formed this opinion over some years you see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of sydney she frequently complained that her policing efforts were wasted due to  bleeding heart  lawyers and magistrates she would bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be back on the street by noon it took its toll they wore her down she quit she has argued since not unreasonably i thought that creative evidence gathering to keep the baddies where they belong was well acceptable  my arguments about the rights of innocent people weren t valid she claimed what are the chances that you will ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime she would argue and being a law abiding citizen the weight of her argument convinced me she was right the chances of me or any of my family or friends being charged with murder or a serious offense were zero to none i thought  hmmmmm well as mentioned earlier seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed all that  i m sending her a copy	1
573	i absolutely adored this movie for me the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like boston legal or ally mcbeal or even la law this is reality the law is not bs won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt like the chewbacca defense on south park this is a real travesty of justice the legal system gone horribly wrong and the work by good lawyers   not the shyster stereotype who use all of their skills to right it it will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any frank capra movie or to kill a mockingbird and most importantly i wept during the film during the featurette included at the end of the dvd   it s amazing wonderful film wonderfully made thank god the filmmakers made it	1
574	i m pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can t be accused of unfair bias with absolutely no cause the jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white foreign tourist they picked a 15 yr old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against her in addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager it makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent this docudrama is well produced professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you won t want to take a 1 minute break if you care about social justice don t miss this one it certainly deserved its oscar	1
575	this is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s everglades it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half there is a scene with the hero running to save her friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing i don t know it is mesmerizing i was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule there are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldn t take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why	1
576	i give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter robert w morgan who also plays the part of jarvis in the film in listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the aarf showrobert morgan is a co hosthe tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and suchthere are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film i think she said that two of the original stars have signed on and she hopes to have a few more robert is a good man and i hope it does well she has devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a sassquatch researcherwhich is also one of my interestsand author check out her show on the paranormal and maybe look for blood stalkers ii sometime in the near future	1
577	quality entertainment all around the spectacle of kermit on her bicycle is one thats as memorable as any in cinema history there s just not a bad thing to be said tons of muppets great cameos slapstick puns whatever you want its here the lovers the dreamers and me indeed	1
578	first of all before i start my review i just read every review for  the muppet movie  here and i can t believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this fortunately there was only one i mean i can understand how someone may not like  star wars  due to the whole sci fi genre but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad  okay i will step off my soapbox now and review this movie  the muppet movie  came out when i was seven all of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie so i think i saw it about four times in the first month in theaters as a child many things attracted me to this and all the other muppet movies & tv shows the singing was probably the main one most of the songs in  the muppet movie  are classics from rainbow connection to i m going to go back there someday they re entertaining and thought provoking as an adult i see  the muppet movie  in almost a whole different light yes the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there but it s the little jokes and such that are just plain hilarious i mean when you think about it jim henson is a sick man  kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces fozzie is a stand up comedian bear gonzo is a  whatever  that is infatuated with chickens then you have two old guys that heckle a piano playing dog a rock band with a maniac drummer a swedish chef that you can t understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric yet for these reasons and more henson has entertained millions of children and adults giving us all something special to watch and remember her by   the muppet movie  will always remain in my heart for many reasons but i think the biggest one is because it s a movie unlike a lot of recent children s movies that i feel comfortable to have my kids watch plus i don t get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids  level it s a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever	1
579	this wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny entertaining sweet and memorable it s difficult to decide where to start from the opening number rainbow connection paul williams s excellent score sung with gusto by kermit d frog which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about throughout the story this is one fun movie essentially it s a road trip movie where kermit travels cross country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain along the way our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors comedians singers and musicians who coincidentally are muppets like kermit herself is this how the muppets really started approximately how it happened kermit tells us not since it s a mad mad mad mad world has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully the aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their odyssey some just blink across the screen but others have very memorable cameos steve martin s amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best puppeteer jim henson s nod to her inspiration edgar bergen is especially touching anyone who ever watched the muppets tv show will get to see all of their favorite characters they re all here the puppetry work is magnificent look especially for kermit riding a bicycle how dey do dat in jokes and references to old movies are everywhere but the best one liners are reserved for kermit herself an example when the crooks are terrorizing kermit and piggy she affectionately says to her short green and handsome beau i wouldn t give up this evening together for anything would you uhhh make me an offer i also love the gunfight at the ok corral scene brilliantly absurd silliness gotta get movin  right along now but to summarize a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie genre taste highly recommended	1
580	this is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure kermit the frog is just an ordinary frog in her swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells her that hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie lol on the way kermit meets fozzie bear miss piggy gonzo and her chicken camilla rowlf the electric mayhem bunsen honeydew and beaker but also trailing kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain doc hoppers french fried frog legs all things considered though kermit and the muppets make it to hollywood this movie is recommended for everyone young and old it has some wonderful musical numbers like the rainbow connection i m going to go back there someday and movin  right along the muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie kermit rides a bike fozzie drives a studebaker and another car gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons which is one of my favorite moments by the way   and kermit and the rest of the muppets finally go the rest of the way by the electric mayhem s bus dr teeth floyd janice scooter and animal who meet up with them in the desert after fozzie s car breaks down even some sesame street muppets make cameo appearances ie big bird is walking along on the road on the way to nyc to break into public television the end is also a very heartwarming moment every single muppet created is in the final scene along with a final rainbow connection reprise but those poor muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks you d think everything is ruined and destroyed but the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all right perfect 10 10 watch it and you ll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie	1
581	as muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best it features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of henson s talent the story is basic and the jokes are many leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable this is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic it rates an 89 10 from the fiend 	1
582	looking back on jim henson s works years after her death is like taking a look back into another time for unlike most so called creative types attempting to sell to or worse yet cynically exploit children nowadays jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child and if there ever was a moment in which she demonstrated this labyrinth aside it is 1979 s muppet movie filmed as an allegorical story about how henson came to work in children s television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half hour show of her own on primetime television the muppet movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s and as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of the muppet show is on offer here i have said it in other comments but i must say it here a great light in the world went out the day jim henson died the muppet movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes in short precise strokes we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors and when the story proper begins boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment the rainbow connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the muppets especially kermit were these were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show they were living things based upon a part of all of us only writ so much more boldly than we are used to as each muppet was introduced to us in turn we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character hence everyone had a favourite when animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal i knew i had found one of mine nowadays i am more of a swedish chef fan but what the hey complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities can you picture that shared an insight into dr teeth and her band as well as the creative soul of henson but the most relevant song to me was gonzo s number asking what she is and where she came from many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and like gonzo saying we knew we would be going back there someday not that all the songs were so deadly serious of course fozzy and kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent or lack thereof and hit the road if any evidence were required that present day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable this number would be it never before and never again would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another with the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game the human cast had a lot to live up to which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal cameos literally pepper the film with everyone from steve martin to telly savalas popping in to offer their support even richard pryor the last man one would expect to see in a film about the muppets appears to set up a hilarious moment mel brooks  cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when i was a small boy but i suspect that is because henson knew why i would find it disturbing now the big acting strength though comes from charles durning who as doc hopper embodies everything both henson and her audience determined to resist at every junction hopper comes to either offer kermit the chance to sell out and betray her own kind or perhaps offer stops being the right word when hopper s attempts to ensure kermit s compliance become progressively more forceful and violent the whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has her heart broken by the world of course animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend in point of fact animal turns out to be the best friend that kermit has in that moment and that has been the core message of every good show or film henson has been involved in ever since that shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes there can be little doubt that in today s world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities henson s creature workshop could never have got off the ground to misquote the album title daring to be stupid is one thing but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter the muppet movie demonstrates how henson dared to ask us all to think both inside and outside of the proverbial box there will never be another entirely like her but she never would want us to stop trying therefore the muppet movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film if we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated this would be it	1
583	i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when seeing it again nearly 30 years later i was surprised at how well it has held up the gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever steve martin s has to be the best one  my kids 9 11 and 14 all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later i would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half dozen episodes of the muppet show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters otherwise the movie won t make all that much sense	1
584	the muppet movie is an instant classic i remember the opening scene with the bird s eye view of the swamp and kermit starting into in my opinion the most loved song in the history of songs at this point my mom would always sing along with kermit watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile i can still sing along to my heart s desire like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are in my opinion still funny today my favorite line of all time is actually from this film it s the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero kermit life s like a movie  write your own ending that s what i intend to do thank you jim henson	1
585	why are there so many songs about rainbows and what s on the other side kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of the muppet movie while singing her signature song the rainbow connection as time goes by the question and the movie only gain profundity i m going to forgo the review of this movie as a children s comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year as the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me i hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone s life because we all dream and that is what this movie is about it s not just a bunch of puppets   it s a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyone and while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good they re not a fair judge of the movie only the rainbow connection and the powerful emotions it will realize and it all fits in rainbow connection *is* the muppet movie and vice versa it s existentialism meets children s entertainment   there s no simpler way to describe it	1
586	a delight from start to finish if you don t like the muppets then i just have to feel sorry for you this terrific film doesn t simply cash in on the muppets  popularity    it s a well conceived and well written film in its own right it s got great songs and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in jim henson s creations and which is most personified in the character of kermit the frog i always responded to this as a kid and it s what makes the muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy a huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie sized version of around the world in 80 days except that it s about 80 times better grade a	1
587	i enjoyed the muppet movie very much it was the first of the muppet movies and is by far the best because it s so creative and fresh with later films the ideas just didn t seem quite so original but here we get to see kermit and miss piggy riding bikes an incredibly difficult scene an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun i loved every minute the muppets were performing and i would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem in this and most subsequent muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non muppets  in particular many many cameos by stars some worked fine such as charles durning s but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt probably the worst of them was with edgar bergan yes she was an amazing man who inspired jim henson and the rest of her crew but the tiny scene she s in just wasn t needed nor were most of the cameos still despite this big complaint it s a great film for the entire family  from the kids to even the most demanding adults	1
588	the first feature length adventure of jim henson s beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as kermit the frog leaves her carefree swampy surroundings for the bright lights egged on by stranded hollywood agent dom deluise who overheard her singing on the way she meets fozzie bear a pitiful stand up comedian at james coburn s el sleazo caf√© who has telly savalas for a bouncer and madeline kahn a patron the piano playing dog rowlf bestial drummer animal and her laid back funky band egomaniacal beauty queen miss piggy in a ceremony presided over by elliott gould and edgar bergen etc all the while kermit et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate charles durning and reluctant acolyte austin pendleton sold cars ice cream and balloons to by respectively milton berle bob hope and richard pryor served food by insolent waiter steve martin nearly brainwashed by mad german scientist mel brooks and finally land an audition in the offices of movie mogul orson welles who has cloris leachman for a secretary the pleasant song score comes courtesy of paul williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at el sleazo s for the record i have recently acquired four of the subsequent muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due	1
589	i ve seen the beginning of the muppet movie but just the half because i only watched it at mrs kelly s friend s house the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious they learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow anyone can make it no matter how small no matter how greenwhich was included in the trailer kermit is my favorite protagonistwhich means it describes the main character and so are the other muppets mel brooks was amazing when she played professor max krassman the scene where miss piggy saves kermit by doing kung fu on those guys it was so cool the muppet movie is the best jim henson film with the most hilarious characters and people will cherish for her successful film	1
590	if i rate the film maybe a bit high you can blame it on sentiment this is one of the first movies that i remember seeing and totally loving i saw it at the drive ins here in california in the late 70s i was already a big fan of the muppet show on tv so i was primed for the movie and the movie did not disappoint basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie kermit the frog is on a quest to become famous not because she wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet but because she wants to make millions of people happy of course along the way she picks up all her beloved muppet friends most endearingly fonzie bear who she meets at a seedy bar doing stand up they sing movin  right along a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery she also encounters enough hollywood movie stars to fill a stanley kramer movie including comedy luminaries like richard pryor steve martin edgar bergen milton berle and mel brooks brooks in particular has a rather dull bit and you are left feeling that henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if she wasn t afraid of offending the stars anyway as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person she meets is dom deluise the ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any children s movie the hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them when a real rainbow pierces the hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery i m sure this was meant to relate to some of jim henson s own personal or spiritual experiences this is the best movie with muppets by a long shot if you or anyone else was wondering why the muppets were so popular back in the 70s considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades i think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue	1
591	the muppet movie  directed by  james frawley kermit the frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together the muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture the story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts the well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction the cameos aren t just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends	1
592	i am 17 and a biased muppet fan and while i love treasure island christmas carol and great muppet caper the muppet movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them it is enormously entertaining thanks to the snappy script by jerry juhl and the film looks lovely with some beautifully staged musical numbers speaking of the songs i really liked them sure they aren t the best song score out of the muppet franchise but they were very nice to listen to especially never before never before is now one of my favourite muppet songs along with first time it happens and professional pirate the muppets as usual were fantastic particularly the always delightful miss piggy and the chemistry between kermit and fozzie was great and what a brilliant human cast  from bob hope to orson welles from madeleine kahnthe same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like what s up doc blazing saddles and clue to cloris leachman from steve martin to richard pryor all of whom made memorable guest appearances if careful not to overshadow the muppets in a fantastic film 10 10 bethany cox	1
593	who doesn t remember the muppet movie kermit the frog is now an american culture icon what child doesn t appeal to this character as the first actual muppet film the movie simply called the muppet movie did very well kermit takes a hollywood agent s advice and goes out of her home swamp to respond to the ad along the way she meets up with a pig a bear chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets watch for dozens of cameo appearances like madaline kahn steve martian richard pryor mel brooks and several more i grew up watching this movie and i loved it	1
594	a bunch of full length movies featuring the muppets created by jim henson & co have been made but the muppet movie was the first one of them all and the first in the original trilogy which also features the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan it was released seven years before i was born so i obviously didn t get to see it at the time nor did i get to see its two successors when they were first released however i saw a lot of the muppets during my childhood mostly after henson s premature death in 1990 i finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid nineties after hearing the soundtrack unsurprisingly i liked it at the time and revisiting it in recent years hasn t exactly been disappointing one day while kermit the frog sits in a swamp with her banjo after singing rainbow connection a hollywood agent named bernie comes by in a boat and urges her to pursue a career in tinseltown kermit takes her advice and goes west she soon meets fozzie bear an unsuccessful stand up comedian in a restaurant and convinces her to come along the frog is also noticed by doc hopper the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants kermit to be her mascot as a frog kermit is disgusted by this so she refuses and leaves with fozzie on their road trip across the country kermit and fozzie meet other muppets who join them including miss piggy who soon becomes kermit s love interest and gonzo unfortunately as they all try to make their way to hollywood doc hopper assisted by max is willing to do anything to force kermit to become her restaurant chain s mascot so kermit finds herself in increasing danger  one thing many people praise this film for is the songs and i can understand why there is of course the oscar nominated rainbow connection at the beginning and more good tunes follow such as kermit and fozzie s catchy road song movin  right along and i m going to go back there someday a poignant ballad sung by gonzo never before never again the song miss piggy sings when she first sees kermit is the only one i would consider rather weak and their romance seems awfully sudden the muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on tv and some of them provide a lot of the humour including fozzie making her first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with her stand up and well if you re familiar with these famous muppets you should know what to expect from each of them some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the insolent waiter also it s not 100% comedy there are serious parts of the film which they also did well watching this original muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing muppets from space one of the muppet movies made after henson s death released in 1999 for the first time last year i was very disappointed when i saw that film which had never happened before when i watched any film or tv show featuring the popular puppet characters not only is that movie not very funny i also think it s a tad too dark and cruel for the muppets as i stated in my review of it however i can t say i think the same of any of that movie s predecessors including this one released twenty years earlier the muppet movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch and since it has so much to like not just for kids that s understandable i highly doubt there s much left to say about the muppet movie that hasn t been said at some point in the past thirty years but today it remains good family entertainment	1
595	i have always loved the muppets though most children s entertainment then wasn t that likable the muppet s was the muppet s are very very funny they are probably the most likable children s characters ever  not only did the muppets have their own show they also have starred in many films from the muppet s christmas carol to the muppet s treasure island the first muppet s movie the muppet movie was also like the show and the other films excellent the muppet movie is about how they all got started kermit the frog used to live in a swamp until one day a movie executive tells her that there are auditions for frogs in hollywood so kermit takes off for hollywood along the way she runs into lots of people such as fozzie bear gonzo the great and miss piggy also an evil man is trying to capture kermit all of the muppet films are highly enjoyable i mean they are all very funny this film has many film appearances such as steve martin mel brooks elliot gould carol kane richard pryor and orson welles the muppet films are all very enjoyable i hear that jason segel is going to star in one soon i can t wait to see it	1
596	i have not seen this movie since 1979 when i was a teenager i grew up with the sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life jim hensen was a genius and master muppeteer when i watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when i was younger and things seemed so much simpler for this bit of time travel i rate this movie a 10 the plot line explores how kermit goes from the swamp to hollywood the laughs and gags are classic muppetism i am glad these films are still around for the next generation i hope i never out grow the magic of the muppets	1
597	this film is one of my fondest childhood memories seeing the muppets at the height of their popularity heading hollywood singing and dancing with miss piggy googely eying her beloved kermit fozzie bear doing her best as everyone s manager and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokey kermit s melancholy ukulele number rainbow connection was nominated for an oscar that year but was beat out by norma rae s it goes like it goes i ll pick kermit s song any day get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasysomeday they ll find it the rainbow connections the lovers the dreamers and me	1
598	the first feature length muppet movie and excepting maybe the muppet christmas carol the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide disney has done the muppets a dis service and this movie proves it over and over again featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos keeps to a simple but original plot classic muppet lame jokes paul williams genius in song writing and electric mayhem madness and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets only croft has come close to hensen s genius with puppets half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor actress still alive i can only hope frank oz and dave goelz and the rest of the surviving muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive kermit and company from the deadly grasp of disney	1
599	who doesn t love the muppets impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm fuzzy feeling inside so i guess what s important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special i don t remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film i recall quite fondly in fact there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self conscious in any bad way refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique the magic transcends all that other stuff  tis indeed what movies are made of so how does the film achieve these things hmmm nice question stumped am i let s see really i feel like it s quite simple the filmmakers believe in their material and don t take themselves too seriously in the process i probably wouldn t say the film has many truly inspired moments but it does have a certain life to it that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack a zest you really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures they also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing generally i get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren t afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session lots of talent little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through the cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance maybe i don t feel i have much to say about it because i was half asleep when i saw it and or as i write this review anyway i m sort of semi repeating myself here but i really liked the sense of family the movie had full of love i suppose you might say again a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly and to repeat myself once more one of the film s best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere like the nathaniel hawthorne quote about happiness being like a butterfly so the muppet movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that anyway if that sounds sappy i also reckon it was pretty hilarious so all in all this movie was very funny touching and difficult not to smile along to plus it features lots of great music highly recommended to all humans both the young and the young at heart	1
600	i would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released all these years later at 37 and i had no qualms hiring it on dvd great entertainment for all ages and what about the song the rainbow connection see why are there so many songs about rainbows and what s on the other side rainbows are visions but only illusions and rainbows have nothing to hide so we ve been told and some choose to believe it i know they re wrong wait and see someday we ll find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me who said that every wish would be heard and answered when wished on the morning star somebody thought of that and someone believed it and look what it s done so far what s so amazing that keeps us stargazing and what do we think we might see someday we ll find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me all of us under its spell we know that it s probably magic  have you been half asleep and have you heard voices i ve heard them calling my name  is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors the voice might be one and the same i ve heard it too many times to ignore it it s something that i m s posed to be someday we ll find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me laa da daa dee da daa daa la laa la la laa dee daa doo	1
601	first of all i d like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind it is the best out of all the excellent muppet movies and every other movie out there so boo ya for jim henson this movie is the first of all the muppet movies and the best boo ya it s about a frog kermit who tries to make to hollywood along with the awesome friends she meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics including the rainbow connection in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing ever if you havn t already seen it then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store if they don t have the muppet movie i d sue them big time 	1
602	jim henson as kermit drteeth rowlf and waldorf frank oz as fozzie piggy and animal jerry nelson as floyd pepper robin the frog lew zealand and crazy harry richard hunt as janice statlerbeaker and scooter dave goelz as gonzo drhunnydew and zoot charles durning and mel brooks cameos by steve martin carol kane orson welles bob hope richard pryor and others this is the first muppet movie of the billion others that came out and is also the best by far this deals with kermit the frog going on a trip to hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way this movie along with being already good has excellent songs performed by the muppets including rainbow connection can you picture that moving right along and others this movie unlike the other muppet flicks carries a strong sentimental value to me it s such a nice movie also noted is it s many cameos featuring steve martin mel brooks and a dozen others my rating a plus 109 mins rated g	1
603	y know it s very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now dead anyways it s been a long time since i ve watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold i m a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing it s not really high speed children s pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character s depth it s just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go kermit the frog is just an awesome character her voice and the expressions on her puppet face are fantastic but above all she points out why she s popular  she can sing and make jokes too  but more appropriately why she s so endearing  she without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime she also has to deal with herself which is an uncommon theme in family movies it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel brook s part was just a bit overplayed do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but it s highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction moving right along   polarisdib	1
604	jim henson s the muppet movie is a charming funny and brilliant film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults and kids i feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters great story and great wit that it is irresistable the plot involves kermit the frog puppeteered and voiced by henson in her odyssey across america to follow her dream in hollywood along the way she meets fozzie bear the great gonzo my favorite miss piggy rolf and dr teeth and the electric mayhem this film has so many good things i can t even say them but it is memorable and every time i think of a puppet or muppet i will think of this film look for cameos from mel brooks dom delouise paul williams madeline kahn bob hope richard pryor steve martin edgar bergen and charlie mccarthey elliot gould carol kane and the great orson welles excellent and spectacular one of the best films of the 70 s a++	1
605	in many ways the perfect movie the incredible journey and horatio alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism in essence the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie life s like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending they create their own reality which has all the trappings of every epic tale a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle laden journey an ever increasing group of like minded individuals for camaraderie a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption and a big budget hollywood ending because darn it all they can only jim henson could pull this off she walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets but in the end perhaps they are the perfect uh puppet to make these points the movie s atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the hollywood dream the happy ending unnecessary cameos and bursting into song at the drop of a hat usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film but the self deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt free viewing one of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all ages the other muppet related films including the empire strikes back while palatable do not touch the simple grace of this film take for instance the musical number hope that something better comes along the duet of kermit and rowlf amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices brilliant	1
606	minor spoilers misunderstood classic remains one of henson s finest and most personal films it may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one  misunderstood  but people do seem to remember this one mostly for jerry juhl s snappy screenplay and paul williams s knockout songs now while these things are admittedly great as is the movie s formal playfulness screenplay within the screenplay film break etc what distinguishes  the muppet movie  from the other muppet films is the serious wistful thread that runs through the picture it s a road movie all right but like most road movies the pleasure is in the getting there and the achievement of the characters  goals is tempered by uncertainty and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again throughout the film we are shown the down side of show business even before the muppets have  made it  piggy abandons kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performer s life on the road in her haunting  i m going to go back there someday  and worst of all kermit is continually tortured and tested by doc hopper who wants her to commercialize her art for the unholiest of purposes one can only wonder what henson would have made of her family s management of the company after her death kermit herself agonizes over her choices in the desert conversation scene and the final  magic store  number questions whether it s all been worth it before concluding that it probably doesn t matter either way all this is punctuated with the expected muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes and of course the serious stuff wouldn t work if it weren t but  the muppet movie  isn t just another jokefest as the rest of the diminishing return muppet films would become no it s a lovely gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business and it s every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago 95 out of 10	1
607	this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo okin played by the incredible haruko sugimara lends money to two other ex geisha tamae chikako hosokawa and otomi yuko mochizuki and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it tamae has a son otomi a daughter who during the film announce they re leaving them while okin never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who you re responsible and beholden to haruko sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding less than compassionate okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her but at the same time almost envy her at a time when great films were made by ozu mizoguchi kinoshita and kurosawa amongst others mr naruse is right up there with her if you have a region free dvd player you should attempt to find the two naruse box sets released in england i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant that they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece	1
608	naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film the other two being ozu and mizoguchi this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique well for those who are interested watch this film one okin is successful as a money lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful okin doesn t have any children but the other do okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited naruse is a master in subtle studies of her female protagonists  characters bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and one s life worth very good film indeed	1
609	a look at three geishas who are way past their prime now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present kin played by floating weeds  haruko sugimura has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender everyone on the block owes her the other two nobu and tamae wish they could land husbands but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will meanwhile their children   one has a son and one a daughter   are both about to get married not to each other tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man nobu s concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature but they are also understandably self serving after her son leaves she ll be alone a bit into the film two of kin s former clients come looking for her one a man so obsessed with her that she tried to get her to commit double suicide with her the other one of her handsomest clients unfortunately she comes for her money not her love the way i ve described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing but it s really not sad but not fatally so it s more bittersweet unfortunately i only marginally liked late chrysanthemums the story seems better when i look back on it but it is very slow and dull i actually nodded off twice during the film and i wasn t at all tired before i started it this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of ozu s more famous films 7 10	1
610	mikio naruse s examination of the lives of three idling constantly complaining single ex geishas in post war japan is a wonderful character piece they used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy she is the only one of the three that has no children the other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income because neither of them work complications ensue when the kids decide to get married though not to each other and leave home this leads to the bitter grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy despite her fortunes she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere   all they really want is to borrow money from her the three characters are all neck deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or at the very most toss complaints back and forth to each other late chrysanthemums is very slow moving and not much actually happens but naruse like all great directors has the ability to do much with very little i haven t seen much of her work but i suspect that this isn t her best even though it is very good the problem i think is that it all doesn t seem to amount to much but the film is full of good points although it is cynical it isn t overly so naruse seems to sympathize with her desperate characters and she paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self made misery while the film isn t a must see it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little known outside of her own country director precious little of which is available on video here in the u s	1
611	for me late chrysanthemums was interesting not only because it was my first film of naruse i completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as her 30s work i ve seen this doesn t mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with breathless in 1959 but quite the opposite the editing was as fluent as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s 40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way she was telling her story unlike them it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle in this sense the film was comparable to ozu s and mizoguchi s work but somehow even more subtle what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera work in dreyer s ordet 1954 or vredens dag 1943 which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us i feel that naruse s editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of her films elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious the wonderful sets and settings shouldn t be forgotten either i found the story itself to be rather conventional the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other   less complex   film somehow i felt that she failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers she had woven maybe she should have kept them intact this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way ozu dealt with the plot in her films unfortunately i haven t yet the feeling that naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in her films  conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion the best efforts i have seen to date   ukigumo floating clouds   1955 and midaregumo scattered clouds   1967   sustained the energy she had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and resonant endings this is already more than most director s are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium in this regard and considering the resonance of the last two films i ve seen by her she may have already become one of my favorites the only problem i have at the moment is where i m going to see more of her films on the big screen	1
612	sadness and nostalgia permeate late chrysanthemums a 1954 film by japanese auteur mikio naruse now undergoing a retrospective of her long unavailable films thanks to james quandt of cinematheque ontario and the japan foundation based on three stories by fumiko hayashi late chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas now middle aged whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret performance are uniformly outstanding particularly that of haruko sugimura who starred in films by ozu s late spring floating weeds and tokyo story among others sugimura portrays kin a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends nobu sadako sawamura tamae chikako hosokawa and tomi yuko mochizuki all former geishas kin s friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how kin has become greedy and tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet both tomi and tamae are in the process of losing their children tamae s son is leaving to work in the coalmines in hokkaido and tomi s daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable two male friends visit kin seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide and tabe ken uehara another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as kin confronts tabe and tomi and tamae console each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who though their future does not seem bright refuse to see themselves merely as victims late chrysanthemums has the simplicity humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way	1
613	subtle delicate touching a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy history of a coming  out and anatomy of relationship soft ambiguous gestures slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift religious traces and a pantheist vision cercle of light and expression nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening a erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values pledge for self  discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation robe d ete is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people	1
614	i expected it to be good after i d seen some other ozon s superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant   clever very bright emotionally and visionally perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence about it s simplicity	1
615	there s not a dull moment in francois ozon s robe d ete it s surprising how much is packed into this short film while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette she invites her to make love in a wooded area near the beach on returning to the beach they find that all her clothes have been stolen she lends her a summer dress to cover her nakedness and requests she return it next day she rides her bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl her gay companion is sexually excited early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended she suggests she keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance it s a light hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes	1
616	i m just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon i ve seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon s films so it doesn t grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul	1
617	this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind one knows it s going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment well forget it the movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of moscow all right it must be said the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder but this movie doesn t let you go it s like the old gangster movies but then without any glamour at all and in russia and that s one of the most important aspects of this movie it s situated in russia this does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense this could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the russian mafia it is a beautifull and terrifying movie it s horror but you can t feel but sympathy for the little mute one last advice don t look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well	1
618	first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i m not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didn t work quite a well but still very scary a good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror lowbudget set in russia unknown cast and made in europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well	1
619	if you want to see a true thriller rent this it s not from the director or screenwriter of scream doesn t feature overacting overpaid tv actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza instead you ll get a top notch edgy very strong in violence yet thrilling nailbiter	1
620	well this film came on on a workday at 230am the cute little actress who played billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes i was held captive to my television till the very end it has you on the edge of your seat then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences the only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film causing certain sequences to drag just a little nonetheless it was still very entertaining and i recommended it to all my co workers the next day	1
621	mute witness is a modest yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves the film ¬ñ written and directed entirely by anthony waller ¬ñ is a tense action packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences no pointless mumbo jumbo or endless plot twists¬Öjust straight to the point mystery mute witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff  movies and is effectively set in russia *** spoilers *** since the production costs are cheaper there a us film crew temporarily moves to russia for shooting a horror film an old hangar is used as film location the female make up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff movie she s caught and tries to escape but since she s a mute she can t cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly the girl s life is in real danger now since there s a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don t want the witnesses to be alive¬Ö *** end spoilers *** mute witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end regarding the similar topic i d say it s definitely better than the more famous `8 mm  directed by joel schumacher and starring nicolas cage the acting in mute witness isn t great but the leading actress who s russian herself looks really cute sir alec guinness makes a special appearance too and a very cool one i may say surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares	1
622	this is a very good movie i give it a 10 it s very different in that it s kind of a long stalking scene all the way through the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way she sees a murder for a snuff movie and decides to run but is chased this takes quite some time i won t reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured it s very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending don t miss this movie	1
623	superbly crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well the cast play it very well although richards  self centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny two scene cameo by sir alec guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow is simply the icing on the cake well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when you re all alone	1
624	an intense thriller about a mute movie make up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night after she tries to get away from the murder scene she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat	1
625	this is definitely one of the most scary and spell binding films ever made you are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end even though there are some plot holes it keeps being exciting to the final showdown besides 8 mm and peeping tom this is one of the best films about snuff movies a taboo theme of our culture if you like the scream trilogy you will probably love that one	1
626	i love this movie  i think i ve seen it 5 times already it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv ok it s a thriller and there is great tension but mostly and specifically in the second part it is absolutely hilarious  and very original the directing and photography are just splendid	1
627	i ve waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on tv eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait it s much better than your over hyped scream or last summer garbage because it s all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don t let that put you off in any way what lies beneath   over hyped and crap mute witness   low budget not hyped at all and very good	1
628	the plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well there is a plenty of comic relief too some things do not make a lot of sense eg the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave the russians actually speak russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models spanning like 50 years and so the place seems weirdly out of time overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well	1
629	i enjoyed the acting in this movie except for the sister she reminded me of janice on friends i could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious  my main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother in law the guy falling out of the exploding car maybe if her hand had been blown off and she ran to the mute for help and she kissed her and rushed her to a hospital maybe then i could have gone for the ending i think somebody needed to die in the execution scene mainly the brother in law she was such a pain in the ass anyway or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute i could have even bought into the brother in law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films  it is worth watching again and as i always say it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author	1
630	this is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever i really cannot believe that it didn t gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors mute witness has all the style suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock depalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn and hot dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is the plot centres on billie hughes   a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory by a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made as the main character is mute she cannot make a noise   something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in others the director seems to have studied her hitchcock very well even the opening scene is a tongue in cheek nod to both hitchcock s psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes while the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end all in all a hugely overlooked well paced and action packed psycho thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy jason scream michael myers damien regurgitation s at hallowe en	1
631	one of my all time favourite movies nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time if i could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time it s still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren t unexpected if you want a see a film that you truly won t be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film its chilling shocking full of suspense and there s also loads of humour to help you through it too if you watch this film and don t love it i truly question your sanity	1
632	i don t know how this film went unnoticed for so long i saw this film on tv i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably  10 minutes but that does not matterthis film literally gripped me it is a real spine chiller the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effectu do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tenseeven though there are many new faces their performances were top class the filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest the shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film the well written situations n twistsfast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller this film actually switches between the genres   horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock  i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks  i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film	1
633	man i never laugh so much this year and it s pretty hard to make me laugh while i expected some hostel style movie the smile came to my face even from the beginning this film inside film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die her overacting drive the director nuts and her funny reaction tell us the viewers that mute witness is not a typically horror movie the main character the mute american make up artist billy hughes is played by the beautiful yet talented russian actress marina zudina her performance is top notch her character can t speak so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensateand oh boy she did a wonderful job her sister fay ripley is the girlfriend or the fianc√©e or the wife of the in film director evan richards they were both very funny most of the time i won t spoil more but the scenes following the bathtub moment with them two the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy the plot get twisted near the end possibly misleading at one particular moment but don t worry such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy  girl  friend	1
634	in today s world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it movies like psycho and blair witch while being great in suspense both with great build ups are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them with mute witness a rare treat i stumbled upon this film and watched it scared witless in the middle of the night i was scared by the menacing russian ambience the  snuff  theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the amusing which always leads to likeable characters could meet the end at any second since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations it also has fay ripley in a rare movie role watch and prepare to be excited scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways	1
635	i couldn t stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime  comparisons to hitchcock are deserved    this thing really plays with you it walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor like many of hitch s heroes our doe eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific    and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication who is to be trusted and who is a monster the plot twists and turns unpredictably suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music    but most simply the eyes of the characters which sends raw fear right into you  a warning there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage slasher pic and a teen slasher pic it ain t the characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing    a couple including the heroine you may even find endearing as i did there will be no mistake you re watching a movie made for grown ups i mean alec guinness is in it briefly and you know she didn t need the work pop this in the vcr some night when you can t sleep   and don t want to yet	1
636	the story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie then the story gets more and more outrageous the main character portrayed by marina sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role this could have been a super great movie had the ending been more realistic	1
637	it is always a well known and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes in the crucial opening scenes the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film here in mute witness we find a prime example of this *scene spoiler*  in the first 5 10 minutes the film opens to a very hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment with the radio on she s wandering around applying lipstick dolling herself up and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose of course the serial killer is in her house and monitoring her moves knife in hand she hears a noise looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood at the very point of her screams she turns around to be faced with the knife wielding maniac who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act then something odd happens as the woman convulses in her death throes the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch her victim perish before she finds her lighter her cigarette is litfrom someone else in the room the camera pans out and we realise that there are more and more people in the room some taking notes some filming some recording the death and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die and making a very hammy job of it too when the audience realises what s going on and the whole scene is part of a film the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour *end scene spoiler*  i have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons firstly it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma with some very disorientating and even blackly humorous moments   it conveys a central subject matter that of the difference between a  movie screen death  and a  snuff film death  an issue which is elaborated on later in the film and finally it introduces the viewer to the characters all as silently as possible the plot of mute witness centres around billy hughes an american special effects make up artist who is working on the set of the film being shot in a large warehouse in moscow billy cannot speak but she communicates in sign language through her sister after the end of an evening s filming billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident and in her attempt to escape is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film but turns out to be a snuff movie suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death without doubt the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping billy s saving grace and her handicap is the fact that she isn t able to utter a sound in fact in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn t chock full of women screaming there are some utterly disturbing moments and some superb set pieces of real suspense the corridoor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples the timing is fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself the second half of the film introduces new concepts while there are still several suspenseful moments the focus is on plot twists new characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film it just doesn t quite measure up to the first half there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes but there are also some very lame comedy moments coming specifically from billy s sister and her fianc√©e who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on that almost ruin the film just because they are badly misplaced and or mistimed and ruin the pace   at the end the twists keep coming at a rapid fire speed and the climax of the film is appropriately as tense as the first half there are several things that really make the movie work the barriers of communication that billy must face both as a mute and as an american in moscow mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation the actress that plays billy natasha zudina does a wonderful job in the film with an engaging on screen prescence and a brilliant performance and finally the direction as a whole but most particularly in the first half of the film which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock s suspense thriller film techniques as i have already said though the let downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke the sister and the moviemaker to turn their scenes into some unusual sit com however despite these shortcomings the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller and ideal for a group viewing at halloween certainly better than the usual slasher horror film	1
638	if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense alec guiness s appearance was nice but didn t really add to the movie i m not sure if evan richard s part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if she was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment	1
639	i went into this film expecting a slasher and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film making this is much more than just your average slash flick there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability   blindness is more common blind terror wait until dark cat o nine tails to name a handful but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can t speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of our mute witness is billy hughes a make up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in moscow she finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie she tries to convince the authorities of what she s seen but finds that no one believes her story recently hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job it s maybe not quite as nasty as eli roth s opus but the gore is more effective and since director anthony waller who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with  the guilty  implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings mute witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch the director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still the plot is put into action quickly and waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film the acting isn t bad for a b movie with young performers marina zudina fay ripley and evan richards delivering good performances the atmosphere is gritty and the russian locations are suitably unfriendly which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere overall mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be the plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on	1
640	billy hughes is a mute young lady working for make up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in moscow by an american director one night billy gets locked in the movie studio later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out that s when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered while being filmed after escaping the clutches of the murderers billy informs the authorities only to be red faced when the men show it was an act billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance i don t know how this heart pounding sleeper passed me by but i thought it was a much older flick there s one thing though it s got to be one of the most jarringly and intense thrillers i ve seen in quite a while it s just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place the first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation underling this is a humorously wicked black streak faults do pop up in the story as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour or better putter comic relief between fay ripley and evan richard s characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful in the long run it probably could have done without despite some cringe moments this aspect didn t hinder my enjoyment of it for me the soft ending they decided to go with just didn t feel right the interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods so multi facet was the context and its thrills there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists really they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke english and so we are caught up in the confusion too the delicate marina zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the american mute girl billy the way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability director anthony waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish well timed and skillful manner without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you the only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by alec guinness the performances by the cast were all fine especially the nail biting turns by oleg yankovsky and igor volkov as the russian murderers this riveting feature that s mostly made up of unknowns is way better than your average dark thriller highly recommended	1
641	a couple of years before scream spoofed the slasher horror genre with savvy self conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation a little movie produced in russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions this movie was mute witness starring a cast of unknowns except an extremely brief cameo by sir alec guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie it told the story of a mute make up artist billie who is working on a film on location in russia produced and directed by her sister s boyfriend andy she is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence a chase ensues and finally she is rescued by andy who take her home as they alert the police the trouble is there is no body no evidence that anything of the sort took place even so a mysterious inspector seems to be on billie s side of the story and to say more would be criminal mute witness is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller it s one that pays its dues to movies like wait until dark and the best of hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts deadpan humor americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless and nail biting suspense until it seems something must snap even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away very smart	1
642	an amazing piece of film that was well conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat brilliantly orchestrated in its timing and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release the acting was generally well done the director should ve asked alec guinness for acting lessons and the shot selections were impressive as in elongating the hall as billy tries to race to the door in the studio this movie didn t let up since the opening scene	1
643	this may be the most tension filled movie i have ever seen in fact it s so nerve wracking i haven t been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but i will since i have the dvd there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watchso if you ve got problems and need to escape for an hour and half this film will get your mind off anything else  the russian actress marina zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker after the day s shooting is done and billie is about to leave she hears something she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone billie s eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse type building there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out the first i described above the second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isn t as well done as the first in fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since it s so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment	1
644	i just finished this movie and my only comment is oh wow jennifer beals is ok as the fiancee but yancy butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite having watched her in witchblade i was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen i gotta see this movie againif only for yancy butler as corrinne	1
645	i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for eleanor bergstein the primary actors campbell scott jennifer beals yancy butler james goodwin iii patrick stewart and leslie caron were very well selected and played their parts with excellence it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd a rare gem	1
646	love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem shall we dance not the overblown gere jlo remake luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a starz promo weekend because as far as i know it s not available on dvd i ll watch just about anything with yancy butler anyone remember the short lived tv series mann and machine  in it and she positively shines in this she does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy hot loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron where s she been all these years this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it recommended highly	1
647	meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970 s this movie plays more like something mr schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway a mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in florida and along the freeway of life the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor the problem is that what didn t end up on the cutting room floor probably should have now available on dvd it s kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004 it rolls along and isn t too difficult to sit through and strangely enough in 2004 we re all still pretty much just hopping in our cars and going faster and faster heading nowhere	1
648	i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my queue i wasn t disappointed when i got it as it s just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drive in theater back then it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the honky tonk freeway america on wheels this was a strange comedic role for william devane as i remember her as kennedy in the 1974 tv film the missiles of october and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as she did it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in cold turkey  where van dyke played the local minister devane s role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes her character seem amusing and real howard hessman and teri garr as the spoiled family in the rv was on target for the time as well anyone who has traveled across country with small children are we there yet will appreciate those scenes the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns it s sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive used zoo animals anyone all in all it s a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80 s well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer	1
649	back in august  81 there was a country ish buzz to movies big hits like urban cowboy every which way but loose smokey and the bandit were all the rage for that reason i suspect the producers of this movie chose honky tonk freeway as the title hoping it would help the movie s box office receipts by drawing in that same urban cowboy crowd instead honky tonk freeway bombed at the theaters and i suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it s time no matter what probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it its too bad this movie bombed but i think it would have anyway even if it hadn t been saddled with a poor title its a movie ahead of its time one could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great uncle anyway to the kinds of comedy made today for its day honky tonk freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn t get popular in comedy till much later on while clearly its a child of airplane its more mature and while its certainly no knocked up it clearly points in that direction the characters are more comedy mature in that they are low key and don t ever think anything they do is anything other than serious the jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations but more than that honky tonk freeway is a real time capsule a great look back at the exceedingly early 80 s the people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did it was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them i don t know if my review is helping you but this is really a good sometimes kind of excellent movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger beverly d angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes so are beau bridges and terri garr terry garr was just about to become the toast of hollywood as her next movie after this one was tootsie which finally made her a star howard hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made back in 1981 howard hessmann was the star of the big hit tv show wkrp in cinncinatti she played its lead character the rascally night dj daniel stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80 s sitcom the wonder years there are also several faces that are no longer with us these days its nice to see hume crowyn and jessica tandy as a an old married couple on a journey jessica tandy would finally pick up her oscar ten years after this for driving miss daisy there is also the great geraldine page in one of her final movie appearances though she d had a brilliant career she didn t get her oscar till four years after this in 1985 s trip to bountiful for which she richly deserved it and she died very soon after getting that award plus there are lots of other faces in this movie actors who aren t big stars but who have done tons of supporting work many are familiar even if you can t think of their name this movie is a pleasant little diversion a bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all in a vaguely altman esk way end up heading towards florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of ticlaw florida which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map and thats also what this movie is about fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system which had only recently been completed it had taken a generation to build from when it was authorized by congress around 1960 through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is and people were enchanted by it everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs only on and off ramps and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible by 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom and this was all new then  the ending is anti climatic and isn t that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment what makes it great is it s the journey not the destination that makes honky tonk freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day forget its title instead let it take you down memory lane	1
650	a wonderful film ahead of its time i think so in the eighty s it was all about winning greed is good  remember that one  i have seen this film more that 20 times to me this is a real desert island film i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love jessica tandy and hume cronin are simply wonderfulalso beverly d angelo beau bridges come in at a close second don t get me wrong there are many more great performance s in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and i hope you a film that you will want to see over and over i think tv shows like northen exposure and now earl owe a lot to this film but remember it is not a tom cruise film	1
651	i remember watching this movie over and over again when i was a kid i loved it whilst i haven t watched it recently i am sure i would enjoy it just the same today its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh the situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative i particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother s ashes who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion  the robbers and the nuns this nice humour style is much missed these days also this movie proved that actor paul keenan dynasty days of our lives was off to a great start i recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop	1
652	a notorious big budget flop when released this robert altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end if you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from a christmas story turns up in a small part rent if from netflix if you read this i bet you will enjoy it	1
653	in the early  80s i recorded honky tonk freeway from the cable since then i have waited hoping it would be on dvd yesterday i found it it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw the old fashioned episode is priceless at this time 4 28 02 only two have reviewed it one hated it the other loved it if you have a dvd player either rent it or buy it as i did	1
654	very memorable comedy it s fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity and the world s largest honky tonk   the great american freeway like mad mad world it s got loads of contemporary talent old boy politics good comedic action and dialog unlike that one it is the target that seeks not the unwitting seekers   they have no idea what they really want as they drift along america s great road nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly laugh but the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing humor and timing and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular the total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling the slapstick is funny but honky tonk freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed all in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are good or bad and the goofy situations we find ourselves in it was just meant to be funny and it is	1
655	this movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but i loved it one measure of a movie s worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years i won t bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes also a good story and great casting the inept robbers are a hoot see it and judge if it ever gets on tcm	1
656	this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70 s starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn t make the cut as a marine dressed in  baby blue  outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard core marine  raider  gere s character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and she takes advantage of vincent s innocence stealing her  baby blue  uniform after getting her drunk and beating her in an alleyway vincent s character whose name is marion takes gere s outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine  raider  marion hitch hikes her way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell like little town in the local caf√© she meets rose hudkins who immediately catches her eye staying with hudkins parents marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine  raider  could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese internment camps as the towns folks go  hunting  3 escapees marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but there s still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit i would have preferred a little more drama anyway this captures jmv at the peak of her 70 s performances buster and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid 70 s were amazingly good jmv performances she was both an action star and a heart throb all at the same time she made a lot of quality movies during her career and continued to do so up into the mid 80 s with the great tv show airwolf she does a very good job in this as  hedge  quietly observing the way people treat her in her uniform as she travels across the country she must have performed some of the stunt work as well  there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like she s the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of her popularity this movie could have done so much more with jmv s talent and her looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and billie is much more dramatic anyway glynnis o connor is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting the outdoor scenes are gorgeous   must have been filmed in canada	1
657	i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time the opening narrative music and paintings by norman rockwell set the tone for me you either love the movie or hate it jan michael vincent was at her all time best and portrayed cpl marion hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way this movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isn t available on dvd or vhs anymore the ending was also wonderful john hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time	1
658	**spoilers** beautifully photographed slice of life home front wwii love story with norman rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for her country but is also someone who thinks for herself and isn t corrupted by the war propaganda that s constantly drummed into her head washing out of the marine corps marion hedg hedgepeth jan michael vincentis kicked out of boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a baby blue marine uniform that shows that she just didn t have it to make the corps humilitated and scorned wherever she went as she s going home to st louis and terrified what her family whom her dad was in the marine corps in wwi would think of her in that she couldn t cut the mustard as a us marine  hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to her is a marine member of the fearless and deadly marine raiders richard gere whom a admiring hedge buys a beer making conversation with richard hedge is shocked to find out that not only is she being sent back to the pacific theater after all the battles she fought in and combat medals she got but the totally gray hair and mid thirty looking richard is going to be 21 next month that s what being in the marine corps and wwii did to her buying hedge a number of drinks richard takes the drunk baby blue outside and knocks her out taking her baby blues and leaves her impressive us marine uniform with some money in it for hedge to ware  as soon as hedge puts on richard s uniform that fits her perfectly she s confronted by this big drunken us paratrooper who calls herself cement head wanting to have a fist fight with the marine raider hedge doing everything she can to avoid trouble is forced by cement head to belt her after she herself cracked two beer bottle over her cement head to get herself warmed up for the big bout between marinehedge and paratrooper cement head hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking her out cold with one punch i guess the trick is not hitting her in on top of her head a stunned hedge tell her cement heads fellow gi s hitch hiking to this small town of bidwell hedge notices this us military internment camp for japanese americans who are there because their considered a threat to us security it s later in the movie that hedge shows everyone what a real hero she is not who the people in the town think she is by risking her life to save one of the hated japs who mindlessly together with two of her friends escaped from the interment camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway hedge risked her life by saving the scared to death japanese american from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town hedge in her actions taught the people of bidwell that not all japs even those who are american citizens are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner rose hudkins glynnis o connorwho s just crazy about her that even hedge at first thinks that it s her uniform not her that impressed her later when hedge admits to rose that she s not what she and her parents thinka us marine raiderthat she is rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed out marine so well that it didn t matter to her at all what she was supposed to be a marine a paratrooper or a post office worker it was what was inside her heart that really counted the film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between hedge and rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other the way the film accurately not phony baloney shows the true feelings of average americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and japanese in particular couldn t have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste baby blur marine does it s best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero s or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during wwii as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place	1
659	i was actually around 13 years old camping near the mccloud river near shasta when this movie was being filmed my family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon when they filmed vincent floating down the river a little triviathe scene where they pulled her out was actually where she started her float down the river and if the stunt man missed the netting there was 20 foot waterfall about 1 4 mile down farther anywayi watched it at the time and didn t get it it wasn t until years later when i saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it it s pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by jan at such a young age her movie career never really took off as expected but of course she later found success on tv i wish this movie was available cause i would love to see it again	1
660	just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard gere s brief appearance as a shell shocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan jan micheal vincent is in her prime and looks and acts like the all american boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as bkirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peace loving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to her wife if you re looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if you re looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you	1
661	cheezy yep poorly filmed you betcha zero budget they proudly claim it on their posters brilliant anyway or because of it for sure this movie celebrates and makes fun of everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent completely gratuitous nudity impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims slow moving zombies great one liners and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket  this is not an all out spoof like scary movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time	1
662	ok so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted right right consider yourselves officially warned and read on in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history   the 1980 s   a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious murder mcgee who butchered her entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard as i m sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where s the beef and in typical 80 s horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get good times no clique or 80 s horror movie clich√©d characterizations are left unrepresented here in fact no stone was left unturned at all ¬ñ we have the cool hero her innocent girlfriend the goth chick the tough thug think john bender the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians and two big geeks as you can plainly see the cast is pretty big usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel not in this case though not a single cast member left me disappointed the acting was very well done everyone from the cool hero in her thriller jacket played by jovan meredith to the grooovy goth chick played by renee dorian to geeks one & two played by cory assink & jonathan brett ¬ñ they all played it straight brought their a game and knocked it out of the park if you re a fan of gary & wyatt in weird science you ll immediately fall in love with the geeks director co writer jeff c smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this if this is what she can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for her when she gets more money for future projects the characters were dead on the atmosphere was perfect the laughs were huge the blood flowed and squirted and sprayed beautifully ¬ñ it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980 s call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons the tag line says it all and says it honestly   excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget   no false advertising here folks as fans of this genre we have to look to the indies and support these hard working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13  horror  or pointless remakes like the hitcher no thank you   no more of that for me in closing i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die is by far one of the best indie flicks i ve gotten the pleasure of watching this year it s a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobeeven the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn t bring back fits of laughter recalling mid 80 s power ballads by reo speedwagon   over pronounced r s on every word starting with the letter  r    then i ll eat my dvd right nowbottom line is if you re a fan of 80 s horror or horror in general no more hesitation   this flick deserves to be in your collection	1
663	loved this movie kicking it old school love the idea love the script love the characters i really really really loved the geeks i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored this was right up with my favs such as saturday the 14th and pandemonium if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound not bad sound but would have liked to have more great blood splatters great murder weapons great costumes i really love the nod to the great 80 s teenager stereotype ala breakfast club and i can appreciate the non cgi suspense really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi i would rather have good fake that really fake fake kisses to the cast and makers oh loved the making of too	1
664	stmd is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget films i ve seen in quite some time director jeff smith who also served as co writer cinematographer and editor definitely shows her love of under appreciated 80 s horror films with this movie anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of 80 s horror movies will definitely love this very tongue in cheek homage to the past stmd definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some it has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80 s horror movies we all love i had a blast watching stmd from the 80 s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn t get enough	1
665	it s the 1980 s and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an ouija board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one sound familiar it s supposed to it s clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80 s slashers with the tagline excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget  can t get enough it s pure entertainment i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror clich√© s but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80 s slasher films though good acting the entire cast was very talented and you don t see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise there was a lot of chemistry between the characters i was very entertained throughout the entire film and i am fully convinced the writer director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers the script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturally the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget i already know this going in this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy although this is not an oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that it s a lot of fun if you like slashers you ll really appreciate this film if you like blood and boobies you ll appreciate it also	1
666	this brass eye special paedo geddon was swamped by complaints  more on that later  when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  sarah`s law  following the abduction and murder of school girl sarah payne  in fact it`s scheduling was delayed while phil collins took legal advice after she found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled nonce sense if truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud  the edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims  chris morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile  cue the child`s frightened screams  like i said very poor taste  other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs   no one knows this but it`s a scientific fact   labour mp barbara follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and kate thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel   morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene  the photos included barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head  a dog`s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to john holmes  hey i never said this show was tasteful did i   it`s impossible to mention paedo geddon without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians  childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject  the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it`s a biting satire  perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of britain before they criticise a mere tv show for exacerbating tensions 	1
667	who ever put that review as  of bad taste  is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square not to mention the rest of the work she has done on the rest of the seriesall is as good as morris  standards if you think that it is  awful   distasteful  or  sick  then i can only think of one thing to say to you go to hell thanks it had to be said i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete jokei would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that haven t you got anything better to do with your time what are you trying to prove thanks for reading my heart filled review on the mattercheers	1
668	chris morris  brass eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints both from the audience and from the people taking part but nothing she has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this the 2001 brass eye special before the hugely overrated jerry springer opera arrived the brass eye special held the record for the most complaints received about any tv program ever aired the sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the brass eye special was unbelievable many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program the subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely misinterpreted the message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program this was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia the show was purely about the media and it s presentation of the subject morris is and always will be a media satirist the notion that the program  makes fun  of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable morris never attempts to do either such thing she merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject using many of her established  brass eye  characters such as ted maul and others morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything morris has done previously using her tried and tested formula morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary in actuality they are made to look like exactly what they are retards all in all the brass eye special needs to be seen to be believed and with one opening line morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001 welcome to paedo gedden	1
669	the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such  taboo  subjects such as paedophilia the newsdesk set the suits the smug presenters the men at the scene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi graphs and stats the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way c list celebrity s will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it ll be good for their career there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact it may be hard to watch with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls as well as 9 11 but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldn t be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media just because it s a delicate matter how this show failed to win any tv awards for it s intelligence observation courage acting and thought provocation is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising	1
670	ida lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in beware my lovely a 1952 film from rko lupino and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being consummate professionals and strong performers in this film based on a broadway play called the man lupino is a world war i widow who rents out a room in her home she s very active and well liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years she s not ready to move on the man who rents her room goes on vacation and lupino hires robert ryan to help her with some heavy duty cleaning in the house she s friendly enough to start but later terrorizes her locking her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as she grows violent and more out of touch with reality the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when she discovers a dead body in another house she s working in it isn t clear whether or not she s the killer since she seems surprised to see the body she might be a split personality as when her personality turns ugly toward lupino she seems to have no memory of her activities when she comes out of it she doesn t know that she has the keys to lupino s house in her pocket and doesn t know why she has tickets to a party that she bought from young children who came to the door beware my lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you re not expecting	1
671	beware my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did a man finds a dead woman so she escapes so she don t get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow s house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer she starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar she then cuts the phones line so she can t get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn t quite right when she comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happened i can see why beware my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy this is certainly robert ryan s most chilling performance i ve seen a must see rating 4 stars out of 5	1
672	a terrific b feature a virtual two hander and set over the course of a day you can see it s stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home both are superb especially the under rated lupino whose initial independence and self control soon crumble before ryan s unhinged intruder today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner much better known as an art director only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock	1
673	i particularly enjoyed delly s review of this film and agree that howard is not the only damaged character howard is rather ruthlessly set up by the script but there is no evidence that her previous employer is actually dead or if she is that she murdered her howard doesn t know and neither do we in terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there she bolts however she never actually harms helen gordon no matter how enraged she is indeed she reacts with horror at helen s fainting spell and the fact that she is holding a pair of scissorsthen she resumes her tidying up and greets the recovered helen with the almost pathetic  i m very tired now i think i ll go home frankly i don t think she s a psychopath a sick puppy certainly but not a psychopath the problem with howard is that she has no real male identity she wanted to serve her country but her mental condition denies her a place in the army she is singularly rootless and isolated no wife no girl no home again at least as far as we know and she does a woman s job   floor s are my speciality helen s niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in her thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job also although she finds herself strongly attracted to helen she is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass she is remarkably powerless   can t fight can t work can t make love helen is justifiably terrified however she tries to connect to her but finding that she doesn t respond normally ie way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose tinted memories of husband ned unwittingly presses all howard s buttons by lying to her in her attempt to escape both characters trapped in the house trapped by fear neuroses rage and memory deserve sympathy i know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers but i felt it fitted well as it offered a kind of release to the characters helen is freed i think from the past when howard tries on her husband s army coat helen s disgusted reaction is highlighted she no doubt feels that the sacredness of ned s possessions has been violated but hopefully her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger perhaps she can move on howard is also freed   from her endless cycle of anger hurt and violence whether she moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable but i hope it s the former great performances from ryan and lupino i prefer on dangerous ground but this is pretty good too	1
674	the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman she is a war widow the set is limited but the acting makes up for this robert ryan is conflicted one moment she seems nice then confused about where she lives at first lupino tries to help her she seems troubled but nothing more dangerous but how do we know the suspense builds i truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense what is this man capable of there are some scenes with oz whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong we keep thinking she will be helped then ryan s personality turns again she becomes like a jekyll hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife worth watching for these two superb actors 9 10	1
675	beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women her first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase she also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season it was dinelli s only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone  the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference dinelli herself rewrote her play for the screen so i m wondering what she thought about that certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story that wasn t the only thing that was eliminated the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there s no reference at all to the time this story takes place in i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino s residence i noticed her truck was a vintage one of the same era the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino s home where she s hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story	1
676	we are in a small town a homely widow ida lupino hires a handyman robert ryan to look after her house she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows erratic by the hour it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic and now she is unable to escape her house beware my lovely is adapted from mel dinelli s {the spiral staircase} story and play called the man pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness one however shouldn t be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture because it isn t it s clear from the get go that ryan s howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist ryan and lupino are a great combination they had also done the excellent and far better on dangerous ground this same year so with both actors clearly comfortable together it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house re prison ryan is particularly strong as her character flits in and out of madness with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy the direction from harry horner is safe {he in truth doesn t have to do much other than let her actors run with it} and george e diskant s cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches with one involving christmas tree baubles immensely memorable falling some where in between being average and great beware my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film noir for fans of robert ryan tho it s something of an essential viewing oh yes and then some 7 10	1
677	when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it i think it was robert ryans best film because she portrayed someone like my father and she was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although she never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made her worse having to humour her just to get by and get through the day was so apt my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed	1
678	the movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for a couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv s early years nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of her mood swings kills her and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan she wasn t very versatile   watching her essay comedy is almost painful but no one was better at wounded idealism on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure lupino s problem is that she s locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep her happy while trying to escape it s a nail biter all the way this is not one of lupino s many fine soulful parts that she was so good at instead it s a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting ryan s already having difficulty with her masculinity and what others are saying about her then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive looking ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality sensing trouble ryan abruptly fends her off   finesse is not her strong suit insulted whiting attacks her masculinity by calling her work women s work that does it up to that point she s been courteous and professional with lupino trying to set herself on a normal path but whiting has hit her raw nerve now there s heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door leaving lupino to pay the price it s a riveting scene expertly done anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black and whites in favor of wide screen spectacles too bad what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front she deserves at least an honorary oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much	1
679	whenever ida lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30 s40 s and 50 s you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures in this film as mrs helen gordonhigh sierra 41 along with robert ryanhoward wiltongolden gloves 40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection if you liked ida lupino who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman s prison and prison warden who was hated this is the film for you to enjoy i truly believe that ida lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry	1
680	i can see that the ratings for this film aren t all that high for this film so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much well i am right and everyone else is wrong just kidding i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan while she truly is dangerous as well as very menacing you can t exactly hate her because she is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man you really find yourself feeling for ida lupino as she destroys her life so with such intense acting and menace why is the movie rated relatively low well probably because it isn t exactly believablebut boy is it entertaining and creative give it a try and don t believe the score of 64  it s a lot better than that	1
681	intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house lupino excellent as always threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner ryan the 2 masters of the genre are at their heady erotic best as they match wits emotions and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post richly hued b & w photography with an unusual amount of close up head shots the young girl who teases ryan is really well directed here improbable but satisfying suburban melodrama	1
682	beware my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man harry horner better known for her set designs robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her the problem is that she is a psychopathic murderer and doesn t know it miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over to little avail she is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well but one of them can t do well because there is something wrong with her she suffers periodic blackouts during which she commits acts of violence which she later forgets  essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and her prey or in another sense a sadist the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer but it takes lupino much longer thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to  win  ryan over in order to make things work get the job done get on with life but getting on with things isn t in ryan s makeup as she is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality and as soon as there is an opening her paranoia asserts itself  as a study in mental illness the movie isn t too impressive what it s superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness with dangerous psychopathology in the mix and its effect on a normal person in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can t  fix  ryan yet we want her to the result is that if one is willing one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside so to speak its melodramatic structure horner shows us gradually the layout the lupino house  a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home we become familiar with staircase kitchen and pantry and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can t	1
683	i first saw this as a kid the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born and fairly recently bought this on dvd in between i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 the pie fight itself and 2 how racist some of these parts were farina as a nubian slave doing voodoo for example i think roach and mcgowan would have been beaten to death if they d tried to do that now notice how the pie fights in the three stooges  halfwits  holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this oneand this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel & hardy s the battle of the century for these filmsremember at that time they all stole from the best each other  one more note laurel & hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn who also appeared in tbotc the  flapper  getting into her car and getting it in the rear end it always escapes me why she was never credited	1
684	shivering shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the our gang talkie era by now hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures and shakespeare is the happy result the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop s wife the kids don t find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant who pulls off her makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume and the terrible dancing girl played by director bob mcgowan s daughter several filmographies mention that shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie this may be true seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight buster keaton s brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies very funny and an early gang talkie classic 9 out of 10	1
685	i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i d be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads there are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob lowe s character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around her zigzagged path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness this is one i think most could enjoy a few laugh out loud even if you are alone moments ensure that i ll certainly be watching this again	1
686	this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough the acting and plot aren t that impressive but the lines just keep on coming this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but it s so kooky that you can t help but be amused the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going i was especially fond of sharon the canuck on shrooms eh however the one that really stole the show was richard s little brother andrew ira heiden her high pitched whining was somehow endearing the whole movie rocked	1
687	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen this in my opinion is rob lowe at her best i m not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental	1
688	this seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing it may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the world war ii era but i recommend that all others beware many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak the story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough but there s no real pacing or tension in the story i also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying partially due to some strong english accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording i give this a 55 100 most folks will want to steer clear	1
689	 ***************************mild spoilers ahead************************** we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the samll screen may be it was the big screen viewing that helped i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission the movie takes off too the search for the german battleship named the brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting i m increasing my rating to 7 10 if you enjoy ww ii films i think you ll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too	1
690	i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship s company well at least based on my service in the 1970s some of the throwaway lines are very witty i m not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer my only complaint is that they didn t show what happened to the irish coxswain and her bride to be or the tattooed po and her i love arabella tattoo	1
691	if you re in the middle of a ferocious war and it s still not clear that you re going to come out on top among the things you ll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civiliansto demonstrate that our troops have the bravery the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause and that s just what director anthony asquith provided the british with 1943 s naval war film we dive at dawn after more than 60 years it s not surprising that some of the movie is dated it doesn t help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring here as in so many other british war films the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in england s finest ruling class establishments in this movie freddie taylor john mills the captain of the submarine sea tiger is clever confident resourceful aggressive in control good with her men humorous with her peers quick to make a decision and it helps that she s lucky her men are jolly tars for the most part competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they re on leave after that things get tense quickly  taylor and her sub are ordered to destroy the brandenburg a new german battleship they just miss the ship when it enters the kiel canal and heads into the baltic taylor assesses the risks and decides the sea tiger will go after it through mine fields anti sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base after several tense situations the confrontation takes place the sea tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive not knowing if it had done its job after a clever subterfuge taylor outfoxes a couple of german destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel she plans to scuttle her sub and surrender when just at the last moment james hobson eric portman a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks german says there is a small danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot she thinks it might still be for the germans the last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the sea tiger back to britain this is a wartime propaganda movie so don t expect failure and did the sea tiger actually put the brandenburg down are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts did hobson have a reconciliation with her wife and small son that left her smiling for once did freddie taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in her little black book you ll have to see the movie  there are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies some like powell s and pressburger s one of our aircraft is missing and the 49th parallel still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn t use obvious shorthand clich√©s others like we dive at dawn were made with enough clich√©s that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made still asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clich√©s the sea tiger s forcing its way through a sub net was tense the stalking of the brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic john mill s no nonsense attitude while she prepared to attack was well handled the fake out preparations to make the sea tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic inside the sub as well as out as you could hope for and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting we dive at dawn is not a classic war film but it s a well made well acted example of its type and time  john mills it s worth noting had a long long career especially in the fifties she played in a number of serious minded films looking back at those wwii days she had the quality of showing grit cheerfulness and perseverance but of also being trustworthy a man england could be proud of as she fought the war top billed in this movie was eric portman a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you d want to put on a sweater everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff upper lip mode but portman manages some complexity for her character mills and portman did fine jobs working together on this film	1
692	this is an excellent tub thumper from the war years john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship filmed in black and white it s well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time if anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda the mission side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines things are cramped and claustrophobic the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine room activities this probably is the first movie in which debris and a dead german is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer and it s the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking   a high risk gamble if ever there was one i m a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire rope net submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of  give  also the engineer was at the same work station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged this too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship   or so i m told there was a wee bit too much shore side drama for my tastes but then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort these niggles aside it s a pretty entertaining little adventure nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime time but then it s no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends too many of them have guilty consciences or our own left wing fascists non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible better than  the enemy below  i think though less demonstrative not so authentic as  das boot  by any means but not so gross either	1
693	any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter day peer in my opinion respectfully the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things for those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing rank and british gaumont studios back in the day frankly i prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over produced hollywood movie ever could this reminds me of powell and pressburger s the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman a favorite of mine john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be mr portman s film but the whole cast shines as for the title sequence am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production s lovely pre cgi gainsborough girl	1
694	the submarine used was not varangian  it  was in fact two boats p614 and p615 both built for turkey by vickers armstorng at barrow in furness but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war p615 was sunk but p614 was eventually delivered in 1945  the confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up p61 as i did and found varangian when in fact the last digit of both p614 and p615 was in fact just painted out there are some extremely realistic moments in the film these turkish boats were very similar to the s class as no s class submarines survive the shots of them as p61 and of the depot ship forth form part of an interesting record now as well as an excellent film	1
695	this movie is all about reality submarine warfare in ww2 was not a clean precise science there were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dial people with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed  good they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their face war is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song it is endured by scared cold burnt hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survive we dive at dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions	1
696	as a teenager i watched this movie every time it was on tv and it was on a lot because of its witty appealing to teenager humor it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing but i love it for what it is  a fun comedy meant to please the audience the teen actors are of my generation probably why i love the movie so much and was like a fantasy cast of everyone s favorite tv shows of the early 90 s  full house family matters fresh prince  all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90 s though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic or perhaps because of its absence i highly recommend it to pre teens and teenagers everywhere	1
697	i think this movie is my favorite movie i am not sure why but it is julia duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile and when i saw this i went crazy it s sort of romantic and i definitely recommend this movie	1
698	this was a excellent back when it came out it had some the best talent available and a funny story between candace cameron and tatyana ali it was hard to choose who is cuter and add in carlton from fresh prince and all the other big names and you get a blockbuster ok a made for tv blockbuster but none the less if you can find this move don t miss it 	1
699	glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner edger buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot with ford a no show the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice leaving ford on the hook for killings she didn t commit columbia pictures  first color feature the desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle this has the irresistible teaming of a young glenn ford third billed but essentially the star and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles including scene stealer edger buchanan as a good natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn t as dumb as she looks and who has quite a few memorable lines a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences melodrama and comedy well directed by charles vidor this is one of the great westerns of the nineteen forties and highly recommended	1
700	this is simply a good ole fashioned westernnot overly complex or long it doesn t deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment still it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning it features former partners randolph scott and glenn ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that ford s cheyenne rogers has been part of bank robbinghe even steals scott s sheriff steve upton s horse without knowing it her good friend for which she is thieving in red valley upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead claire trvor portrays countess maletta a friend of cheyenne s who gives she and buddy nitroguinn  big boy  williamsa place to stay for the time being cheyenne desires to go straight but finds that hard when jack lesterbernard nedelland her bad bunch want to rob red valley s bank it is actually jack who is behind the murders but cheyenne s troubled past is hard to get away from she and nitro will be charged with the murders they didn t committhe robbery was one cheyenne didn t commitand it will be upton who must somehow save the day before lester gets away with murder there are sub plots which include cheyenne s falling in love with alison mcleod{evelyn keyesthe irony of the story is that alison s father uncle willie is actually in cahoots with banker stanley clantonporter hallin a planned united theft with lester to steal the town of red valley s loot} will upton uncover uncle willie and banker clanton s treacherous scheme will uncle willie be able to go through it without her conscience always bothering her this film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout columbia couldn t have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such don t expect to get your socks blown off but the film is simple and well paced	1

702	randolph scott and glenn ford were once outlaw pals together but now scott s a sheriff and young ford is still hiring her gun out she gets hired to pull a bank job but is delayed getting to town and those that hired her get someone else that leads to all kinds of complications a lot for a film that s not even 90 minutes long randy and glenn both got girls here claire trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold and evelyn keyes is the daughter of edgar buchanan who falls for ford big time without realizing who she is or why she came to the town that scott is the sheriff in it s b western but unusual for the time and for columbia pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment the desperadoes marked glenn ford s first film in technicolor a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios harry cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it and definitely not during war time the plot gets a bit convoluted as both ford and scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency duty the plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in randy s town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned the four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is guinn williams as ford s lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick the climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one	1
703	probably because this is columbia s first film in color the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes they seem to be stronger sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic but very pleasing randolph scott is the sheriff a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young glenn ford who is an outlaw that wants to change evelyn keyes is the woman that starts falling for ford and claire trevor is the countess that runs the saloon there is a funny character called nitro that does not think twice before blowing it i particularly enjoyed two moments of the film one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses there was no computer to help at that time so i presume they must have gathered all those horses no easy task another moment is the final shootout technically very good there is also quite a fistfight seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes makes you come to a sad conclusion they don t make them anymore would they be able to in case they wanted i have my doubts	1
704	the desperadoes 1943 is a genuine classic not for its story which is fairly routine but for its technical production elements this was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a columbia production a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation only fox s jesse james also starring randolph scott from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre although it would be eclipsed in a few years by the searchers and high noon the desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure  in 1863 the economy in the town of red valley utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the union army the script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad which was several years away in utah s future and custer s last stand custer was busy fighting stuart in pennsylvania at the time but these are not important plot elements  red valley has an honest sheriff steve upton scott but the banker and several citizens are corrupt robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses the town is visited by cheyenne rogers glenn ford a famous outlaw who is an old friend steve s she wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner alison mcleod evelyn keyes cheyenne s partner nitro rankin guinn big boy williams is mainly there for comic relief as are uncle willie mcleod edgar buchanan and the town judge raymond walburn who models her character on frank morgan s wizard of oz crystal ball faker  taking no chances with their huge budget columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but indians and covered wagons there is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed a spectacular barroom brawl an explosive climax romance and three strip technicolor all this stuff doesn t necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943 unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy  the cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming the indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences  scott and claire trevor were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote ford who would soon be their biggest star and director charles vidor utilized the film to showcase her new wife keyes whose portrayal of scarlett s sister in gone with the wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films  the ford keyes dynamic is the desperadoes most unique and important feature rather than go for the clich√© love triangle with scott and or trevor which it first appears will happen the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors this was probably the best role keyes ever got and she makes the most of it playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like kiera knightley s character in pirates of the caribbean this was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the waac for wwii military service  the desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new unfortunately there are no special features on the dvd  then again what do i know i m only a child	1
705	this movie was very good i really enjoyed it tom mccamus  performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son edmund i also enjoyed the set design house and the costumes	1
706	this is a great movie the best role peter strauss ever did the music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw only in the seventies did they make them like this one	1
707	i read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature finally it s about time hollywood got their act together the big studios always frown at edgy material with oscar written all over it go figure jericho mile was made ahead of it s time it s a masterpiece michael mann a true visionary found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence peter strauss  emmy award performance is probably the best character role i ve seen in my film viewing lifetime any actor who touches this role will never be the same unless an academy award is already sitting on their mantle the gritty multi ethnic ensemble a backdrop for the jericho mile makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world this is about redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers imagine a convict imprisoned since she was a teenager for life with no chance of parole that doesn t know she is possibly the fastest runner in the world what would you do this movie makes you walk away feeling you haven t been cheated on any level totally thrilling engaging emotional and a rolling stones soundtrack that kick s ass i always thought this would be made for the big screen can t wait in the meantime i ll have to continue re watching my weathered vhs copy i ve had for many years	1
708	the first time i saw this film i was a kid i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv i remember watching it alone¬Öand crying afterward it was only the second film to illicit that response rocky was the first and there haven t been many since i can t say why exactly larry rain murphy didn t deserve to win any more that rocky balboa or anyone else i know i admired murphy not so much for what she did but for the way she did her time stoic she didn t need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity she ran because she could she needed no other reason i have a rule today that when i see this film late at night on cable television the only time most will come across it i must watch no matter what i have to do the next morning fortunately it doesn t play often like shawshank redemption or other favorites so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man s unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory	1
709	a film that deserved theatrical release this made for television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images always with mr mann the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy award winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographer this film is definitely one of my all time favorites while nothing is perfect this film comes very very close along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss there is an all star ensemble of character actors at their finest roger mosely brian dennehy ed lauter geoffrey lewis richard moll miguel pinero william prince burton guilliam ji tu cumbuka richard lawson and billy green bush you may not recognize the names but you will recognize every face if this comes on tv sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film i highly recommend recording it since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 encoded	1
710	i love watching the jericho mile i mean watching peter strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter i think peter strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie she is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing no man alive can out race rain murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but her i ve watched the jericho mile 100 s of times and will watch it 100 s more great movies get watched more than movies that are not i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make itthey are great people and i bless them allthank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all	1
711	peter strauss by nature of appearing in mini series and made for tv films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews   usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel hopped into it half way through well i ve just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile   that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film peter strauss won an emmy for her role in this film and watching it even once will show you why she deserved it so much  looking to be objective i attempted to criticise this film instead i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit picks this is what true realistic film making is about this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted   it s so realistic and true to life that people have thought it s based on a real event	1
712	i really enjoyed this movie   i like prison movies in general i m not sure why    i m sure some shrink could make something out of it i spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago and i knew then i would never go back   i got the individual version of scared straight i did get locked up in an isolation cell on alcatraz for a couple of hours compliments of a park ranger but that s another story anyway the genre really interests me the soundtrack specifically sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones was the perfect backdrop for the film to this day i think of the jericho mile every time i hear the song	1
713	an interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out her days peacefully elements of the main character appear in michael mann s later films like thief 1981 heat 1995 and so on you can see this one at the ucla instructional media laboratory   one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public it s a great one	1
714	i ve never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest i have ever come i gave it a 9 there are very few movies that i truly love this however is one of them with it s gritty realism fantastic on site locationing and it s great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when i first saw it in 1979 at that point i didn t know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive & live free i doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way i was all those years ago but i will say this if you haven t seen this movie i envy you this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time for each of us they re different but here s to the rarest movies of them all the ones we actually love	1
715	i watched the this the other night on a local station because i didn t feel like watching tripe like  american idol  peter strauss gives a great performance as a convict named  rain  murphy who keeps to herself she admits to her crime and makes no bones that she feels no shame for it her cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures the only time she feels in another zone is in running she does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes when a college coach hears about this she wants to prime her for a shot at the olympics at first  rain  wants no part of this but when her best friend is killed she shows interest this is a good movie period strauss is very good what did you expect anything less and michael mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later this movie had that bit of realism probably because it was filmed among convicts it almost feels like this was a true story the additional casting is good there is a lot of notable names like brian dennehy roger e mosley and richard moll as well my heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldn t let her run because she didn t feel bad for her crime her final act made me stand up and cheer when they took her dreams away she took them back hard this was back when tv movies were actually good  the jericho mile  is a gem of a film espn classic please show this film	1
716	i watch a lot of movies   dvd features and classics you name it the night i watched jericho mile my wife who had ordered it on the internet said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years somewhat reluctantly i sat down with our daughter & son and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles we all were  she who remembered the original and our kids 18 and 16 who had no idea what the movie was about couldn t believe it our favorite scene bar none when peter strauss so passionately bangs her fist down and says i d do it again it didn t advocate violence because it was a defense crime but evoked such intensity we couldn t believe itwhen her fellow cell mates gave her their food in support of her efforts there wasn t a dry eye in our house someone please make more movies like this one unbelievable	1
717	the film is not for everyone some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural there are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments there is a lot of indecision an lot of conflicting feelings actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject sex with minors it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors and complex because the characters don t know if society is right or if their instincts are right some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship who was damaged did good come out of it was it art who was damaged more did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity and probably most important was this truly a crime the film is resolutely neutral on all of this and it is this neutrality that is its strength it is the reason for the understated acting the simple sets the lack of background music soft lighting and the general flat presentation the message is clear we don t really understand this kind of relationship today and quick judgments are bound to be shallow	1
718	jennifer montgomery s art for teachers of children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece montgomery s gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14 year old jennifer s seduction of her married boarding school guidance counselor the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer caitlin grace mcdonnell and jennifer s mother actually voiced by ruth montgomery on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i ve ever seen captured on film the lesson ultimately learned here there s nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art well i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of art for anyone interested in thought provoking independent cinema	1
719	to summerize this movie nice for tv but too small for the theatre i enjoyed watching this movie at home but i wont watch it a second time the concept is good but what ends up in the movie is just a summary the end had a  nice  twist but is still unsatisfying maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasn t worked out like a it should be but then again it s an ok kind of movie	1
720	if you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand plot is sarah carly pope a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles vern adrian paul is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence referred to as the design is revealed brendan fehr s character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than she seems all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done and it s definitely an original concept a rare find these days i personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them weren t very difficult it was still a fun movie well worth the rental  so if you haven t seen it    get it  d 	1
721	this is a cult classic for sure it is tricky to follow at times but then again so is a film like jacobs ladder or even say fight club if you want standard fare then i figure go rent the care bears movie or perhaps an old disney classic but if you want  to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to enigma s and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think for me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout so while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy	1
722	i watched this film not knowing anything about it i had presumed it was a sci fi b movie of some sort how wrong i was the plot is enthralling and intelligent the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple i am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as i thought it was quite unusual if you liked the film se7en seven with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this there is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all it is all about the plot about building the characters and building an atmosphere it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not	1
723	set mostly in the back streets of toronto ng is a dark  mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman  vern and sarah   each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past  fine dialogue and first rate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girl s search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life aided by her  anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest  but with a price to be paid the film never intends to answer all of its mysteries  but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists	1
724	i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don t forget those that make you doubt your reality a problem could be the quality but that doesn t bring down the essence of the movie the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer i just totally loved it so many clues and twitches and puzzles one of the best movies ever hands down	1
725	this film was probably the best scary film i ve seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept since noone truly knows that answer you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak carly pope her performance anchored the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie thankfully watch this movie you should enjoy it t	1
726	what can i say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian mcshane i was not disappointed in the least ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to her role she s always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actor as for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly weren t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was a fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul s performance though i must admit i have only ever seen her in the highlander television series before this movie the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expected a clear cut by the numbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie clearly wasn t watching the film closely enough this film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is the idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee i certainly did no car chases no explosions no bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved ****** warning****** if you re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly you might not enjoy this film	1
727	a raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn t quite attain i did still enjoy the film immensely it had great elements of suspense leaving me with that delightful spine chill i expect from thrillers and it achieved this purely psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and gore the soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly at times it was a bit unpolished particularly the acting and character development it could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline after all they seemed to continue to seek it despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it i would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough	1
728	i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles i think the type of people that wouldn t like this movie would be those who don t like solving things or those who get frustrated when they can t solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all i want to say on that the riddles are good some are hard some are not but the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more something more i want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it to find it you can not look for it to never look for it would be no way to find it leave your mark and it will find you	1
729	it could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie you don t have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching but i think that is totally missing the point if your expecting fast cars t&a or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don t watch this you ll be disappointed and dumbfounded this movie was thoroughly enjoyable kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think the writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end just remember to keep an open mind note the school scenes were all filmed at mcmaster university and most of the rest was done in toronto	1
730	nemesis game is a mind bending film filled with riddles death mystery and philosophy in it s simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you ve finally found them all the search for answers leads sarah novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling the final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth yet sarah is so close to understanding it all what would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life the movie was written and directed by jesse warn while this was warn s first feature length film the movie doesn t reflect that at all but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story carly pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch i would definitely love to see more of her work being based on riddles this is a very cerebral movie it s that s your thing as it is mine then i totally recommend seeing nemesis game rating 45 5	1
731	as a late going patron of the drive in thearers 1970 s 1980s there are many movies that i have seen & forgotten this is one i could never forget despite its low budget exploitation style of movie making the story was very well done the isolated therapy asylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the supposed assistant doctor taking over the various crazy paitents the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple minded sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed made for a great story which held the film together i emphasised the word story because that s what makes a good or great film no matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the story is not good then the film is not good the film credits show clips of all the actors including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back which is a great ending to this film if it is out on video dvd see it & enjoy it	1
732	sweet young nurse charlotte beale a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout rosie holotik goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by dr geraldine s masters the excellent annabelle weenick among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable aggressive nymphomaniac allyson king the luscious betty chandler loopy judge oliver w cameron a gloriously hammy gene ross paranoid vietnam veteran sergeant jaffee nicely played by hugh feagin gentle giant sam the amiable william bill mcghee and nutty old hag mrs callingham the supremely irritating rhea macadams said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by dr masters which of course results in a rash of brutal killings director sf brownrigg working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by tim pope does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia robert farrar s spooky score the grimy set design a few wild grisly murders bruce b alcott s grungy no frills cinematography plenty of deliciously robust scenery scarfing histrionics from a game no name cast ross in particular is a total eye rolling hoot and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70 s low budget regional horror exploitation cinema	1
733	this film also known as don t look in the basement is actually not bad it is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but i found this movie pretty entertaining don t get me wrong it s certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look the story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me i thought the acting  which seemed forced at first somehow got better as the film went along it seems like the actors really got into their roles there are some good colorful characters including a guy who thinks she s still a soldier one who thinks she s a judge an adult with a child s brain and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her the title don t look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film if you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like i do check this out	1
734	don t look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting sure it s not a masterpiece by anyone s standards but it is a very fun little b film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head as i said the acting could have been a lot better but that s the case with most exploitation so i can t really complain the story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing i thought the gore was a lot of fun too there s just something great about older gore films because they didn t have cgi back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves see this one for a good time	1
735	i just discovered this obscure  70s horror movie while browsing on youtube for a low budget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that she s a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there s one scene with the curly haired young man as she attempts to seduce her that turned me on before her pulling back made her screaming mad the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and i m not surprised she posed for the cover of playboy some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous for the most part however don t look in the basement that s the title i saw on youtube provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining b movie	1
736	clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of argento but with other 70s low budget drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic the lack of money shows does anyone care too much the acting is adequate rather than professional does that make it more realistic but unlike so many other movies and not just low budget ones this does not drag for a moment crap it may be but non stop crap in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what i m talking about at times quite delirious this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch	1
737	widely known as don t look in the basement   this is pure 70s horror b movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre s version of one flew over the cuckoo s nest though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of it s runtime i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies   such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man child and a loony nymph after their head doctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under staffed facility who becomes immersed in the resident s different ticks and outbursts things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual you never really know or care where the movie is going  cause it still entertains up until it s completely whacked out ending several of the twists felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood but i really dug this much too under rated blend of humor and horror check it out	1
738	back in the 70 s a small time texas filmmaker named sf brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low budget drive in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years before viewing her first film don t look in the basement i wasn t too sure what to expect but i sure as hell didn t expect it to turn out to be the only texas horror i thought was better than the chainsaw massacre i don t know this might actually be my all time favorite horror movie we begin in an isolated insane asylum at first it seems like a rather laid back place to get mentally healthy considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot as if it were their house i guess it is none of them seem all that dangerous only delusional the residents include a love nympho a 700 year old woman a man child a spaz a guy who thinks she s in a war a woman who thinks she has a baby and a guy who thinks she s a judge one day out of nowhere judge kills the doctor with an axe shortly thereafter the wanna be baby mama kills the nurse ten minutes into the movie and things are looking really ugly perhaps the new nurse will know what to do then again perhaps not giving away more would do more harm than good it s best to plunge head first into this one knowing as little as possible if you can appreciate honest to god untampered with horror then you will not be disappointed  if you liked scream if you liked wrong turn if you go for that unoriginal over produced over scored digital hollywood garbage then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one don t look in the basement being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking the atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove unfortunately good ol  sf used up most of her good ideas on her first movie although the next entry in her texas sized quadrilogy is somewhat of a masterpiece that is if you re into extra sleazy mean spirited hixploitation like someone i know if you fall in love with brownrigg s first two and absolutely must find out what else she had to offer check out don t open the door and the house where hell froze over don t look in the basement has everything that successful horror needs no stars no budget no digital effects just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum with a dozen cast members and a somber subtle score and of course the twist this is real horror for the real horror fan 10 10	1
739	although it isn t mentioned very often don t look in the basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch the story follows a young nurse charlotte beale who is hired at stephen s sanitarium to replace dr stephens after she is murdered by a patient many patients begin to torment miss beale and her boss dr geraldine masters acts as if she s hiding something this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesn t happen very often in horror films the musical score is great and is reminiscent of dark shadows the performance from rosie holotik rhea mcadams and bill mcghee are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending this movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film i have ever seen has been able to capture many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic don t look in the basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive in films	1
740	a nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by doctor stephens she is upset to learn that the doctor has diedleaving her assistant doctor masters in chargeshe is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy judgea shell shocked vietnam veta catatonic and a creepy nymphobut is soon befriended by a hulking black man samshe needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around herdon t look in the basement is my first horror film of sf brownriggdespite its low budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk spindle through an eyeballthe climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera workgore and piercing screams8 out of 10	1
741	dr stephens michael harvey head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane takes a  progressive  approach towards the treatment of her patients even allowing her loonies complete freedom of the building day and night she pays the price for her forward thinking however when she rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of her patients and consequently gets her neck mistaken for a log serves her right for not suggesting basket weaving shortly after this tragic incident nurse charlotte beale rosie holotik arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor s assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner dr geraldine masters annabelle weenick despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor s decision to employ ms beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff dr masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away it doesn t take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the  lunatics have taken over the asylum  schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but sf brownrigg s don t look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters lobotomised popsicle sucking sam bill mcghee judge oliver w cameron gene ross who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases old mrs callingham rhea macadams who recites william allingham s creepy poem the fairies and warns charlotte of impending doom cackling loon danny jessie kirby who delights in teasing the other patients harriet camilla carr who thinks her doll is a real baby army nut sergeant jaffee hugh feagin and best of all allyson king betty chandler whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her this convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from brownrigg who also gave us the impressive white trash horror scum of the earth and a solid turn from playboy covergirl holotik all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker	1
742	i m not sure what intrigues me about this movie so it is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull the person i was watching it with fell asleep twice and yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though i am not sure what perhaps the character of sam an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop or the marvelously played head doctor i forget her name anyway watch it and form you re own opinion it has one of the greatest endings i have seen in film	1
743	young ambitious nurse ms charlotee rosie holotik is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere during the course of 3 days she encounters strange happenings even a patient in her bedroom watching her yet she still stays the mental patients are all a little eye rolling espically by the judge but my favorite was the old crazy biddy rhea macadams the storyline is okay at best and the acting is surprisingly alright but after awhile it s gets to be a little much but still it s fun quirky strange and original note the thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying so the title is a little bananas	1
744	 don t look in the basement  is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that brownrigg is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly overdue some proper recognition  don t  is her undisputed masterpiece this scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for brownrigg s world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness and she uses her low budget palette to wrap her grot blanket around you like a bad memory there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing in a word classic also if you watch  don t  first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks brownrigg s other films in summary they really don t come any more esoteric than this   well actually they do track down brownrigg s  keep my grave open  mad genius accept no substitute	1
745	 but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn t be here it s so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like i did because this little known gem receives no word of mouth from the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but don t look in the basement plays it subtle which makes for superior suspense note to horror filmmakers some of us do like subtlety lovely and homely nurse charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor who we all know isn t a doctor at all the suspense is built through charlotte s unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients but which of the patients can charlotte trust this is a gem and is my absolute favorite true horror movie i love re animator and evil dead but they play more for the horror comedy crowd violence $$$ quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film the opening scene is classic no other horror film starts out better and the end has its fair share of gore as well nudity $$$$ eager to fall in love allyson betty chandler spends a good deal of time naked attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium betty chandler is a knockout and i am shocked that this is her only film credit story $$$$ the story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in hollywood the script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor charlotte in a precarious situation acting $$$$ betty chandler does the best job here as allyson capturing dementia with naivet√© in an ethereal form the judge was splendid as well weighing facts before she came to a verdict while rosie holotik as charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character	1
746	don t look in the basement this little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the video nasties list the flute sitar rattle box soundtrack is classic the main character although way hotter than most low budget starlets is a pretty standard low budget lead the doctor masters character is well written and well acted some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie it s campy i ain t trying to lie the character that makes this great is a faulknarian man child named sam one of the patients in this sanitarium gone mad flick the gore is pretty standard although i think the color of the blood is awesome it s so red this movie i believe was received poorly because of it advertising scheme some soulless little ad executive got her grubby hands on it and thought  let s rip of the ad campaign for last house on the left that s doing well little chumps like this have ruined the world of film all balls and no brain also the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic maybe there all drunk you ll see what i mean one more little note don t buy this from the wally mart dollar rack they have cut it to and unwatchable level try to find the longest cut you can	1
747	yet another in the long line of don t films of the late 70 s and early 80 s yet this one is much more than that this film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist it has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it s the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors actresses that make this movie good a young nurse arrives at dr stephens  progressive mental hospital right after she has been murdered by one of her patients and all is not what it appears to be it seems dr masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over her duties and begun to implement her own ideas each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions there is the nymphomaniac the crazy old crone the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants and a man who has reverted back to her childhood among others there is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up if you are a fan of cheap 70 s sleaze than this is the film for you	1
748	the impossibly sexy rosie holotik plays charlotte beale a new nurse at one of those movie type asylums where the doctor in charge has her own unorthodox ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious dr masters anne macadams aka annabelle weenick the inmates don t take too kindly to charlotte either part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director sf brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it these colorful psychos including a nymphomaniac with no self esteem a gentle giant who s already had a lobotomy and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon dominate the screen with their unnerving presence it s a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality it builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry quoting dotty old mrs callingham for cheap 1970 s era cheese it s pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it 7 10	1
749	i found the film don t look in the basement to be very good with some great characters in it it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte bealerosie holotikwho is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including dr geraldine masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting her with an axe my favourite characters in the film are mrs challinghamreah macadams a very funny little old lady allison who is a nymphomaniac and sambill mcghee a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of her own all of the time the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film i know that it was on the  video nasties  list back in the 80 s but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended	1
750	i personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so i had a good feeling about watching this don t look in the basement even though its reputation is doubtful well turned out i was right this is great trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters you have to of course look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but if you manage to do that and if you re a fan of this type of horror that s an essential quality you ll be rewarded with an outrageous video nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements the young and cute nurse charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she s supposed to start her new job she finds out that the doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor in charge masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival the life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked after a whole series of bizarre events charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides the opening 10 minutes pre credits are great and so is the completely deranged climax everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun the asylum s patients are textbook lunatics but i love them nevertheless some of my favorites include the former judge who still talks exclusively in legal terms the suspicious army sargeant and the mad raving old lady don t look in the basement is great low brained fun especially recommended to fans of 70 s trash cinema sick puppies and other types of scum the lunatics have taken over the asylum yeah	1
751	low budget but memorable would be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre vulnerable naive nurse charlotte beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her  the lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style as well as a cast of wacky characters the pleasures of this film don t come from the film s shocks which are fairly tame but from the weird atmosphere first we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real there s also an axe murdering judge a shell shocked war veteran and old mrs callahan is like everybody s daffy elderly grandmother gone amok a young patient named allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning a big guy named sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy and jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts the only other sentient person in the place seems to be dr masters but does she have a secret don t look in the basement is a great example of low budget exploitation films there isn t much plot going on but the cheapness works for the movie several cast members turn in memorable performances particularly betty chandler and annabelle weenick and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with you the scene between allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time and especially delicious are the facial expressions of dr masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany my favorite cue is the crazy cue a sitar that twangs whenever one of the patients does something pathological also wonderful is the way that charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax with the patients revealing that dr masters is simply another inmate and then suggesting that charlotte is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact the scene where charlotte manages to finish off the barely alive dr stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low budget horror yes don t look in the basement could very well be the american beauty of grade z trash	1
752	this is such a fun and funny movie highly entertaining at all angles it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts we got the judge the sargent the kid the creepy old lady the slut the clown and unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn t have any locks and is understaffed so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous we also learn a lesson along the way never give your patient an ax  this was before cukkos nest and surpasses it at least on the fun level it even has its sweet moments love is pure love is grace love is strength you love me your love is pure you ll always love me now who could resist that nuts are humans too just a few loose wires be a little careful or you ll get an ax in the back children at play hehe the telephone repair man was really funny and her reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine all the characters in this film are tremendously well played and i really did find them funny no hilarious they may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them or how they can take advantage of you this is actually a very smart movie there is a brilliant twist ending i must say i expected this to be a good but never expected this it is horrific the court has made its decision you are no longer in control i love it the ending is so so perfect you ll shed a tear i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this i will never forget it now it is not just a cult it is a cult classic whatever you do don t look in the basement 	1

754	if anyone ever assembles a compendium on modern american horror that is truly worth it s salt there will *have* to be an entry for sf brownrigg s ubiquetous exercize in asylum horror every time i watch this movie i am impressed by the complete economy of the film from the compact totally self contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non professional actors and a prevading sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrarive with a certain inevitability which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the heroes with the only question being when are they going to wake up & smell the coffee shot on a dental floss budget in brownrigg s native texas at an old palatial manor that nicely serves as the setting for a private sanitorium don t look in the basement is another intriguing twist on the good old edgar allan poe tome about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal outsider unwittingly joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems they are totally cut off & beyond any outside help and inevitably find their own sanity questioned as the madness spins out of control    the original star trek tv series had a go at this with their whom gods destroy episode from 1968 juan moctezuma gave the proceedings a peyote fueled mexican psychedelic trip in dr tarr s torture dungeon in 1972 and tangentially related is fernando di leo s asylum erotica slaughter hotel which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as splatter cinema    brownrigg may not have seen or been thinking of slaughter hotel but she sure came up with some similar ideas legaliciuos former playboy playmate rosie holotik plays charlotte beale rn in clinical psychology who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god forsaken waste right out of a peckinpah movie to work with a dr stevens at her private sanitorium dr stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based upon basically encouraging the emotionally & psychologically scarred to face their inner obsessions bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning nice idea but arming a 6ft 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling her to pound out her aggression and then turning your back on her probably isn t the smartest idea and dr stevens is dispatched before ms holotik even appears onscreen with a good whack to the lower portion of her skull this event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one geraldine masters actress annabelle weenick who also served as the script supervisor & production manager a woman of startlingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of sam the film s wonderfully unlikely hero a lobotomized african american boheomouth played by an actor named bill mcghee who was sadly robbed of a supporting oscar nomination for her turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy sam s one wish is to have someone help her put her prized toy boat in the water and her continual asking of the various female cast members to do so and her nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles as *some* kind of underlying theme though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up there is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients but i ll leave the details of that to your discovery ms holotik arrives just as dr stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of ms masters who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened oh twenty minutes ago which you must admit was rather sporting of her holotik s nurse beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer however when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors & doesn t trudge off for the nearest ace hardware store to pick up a hasp and padlock to secure herself and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room & do stuff like smell her hair try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with axe heads but that s all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment ms master s informs her and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a 42nd street fetish boutique and getting to know the inmates allysson is a obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendancies who likes to take off her shirt & provide the film with some t & a between fits of histrionics harriet is a young former mother who let her child die in a stupid accident and now dotes on a beat up old doll that she is also homicidally protective of the seargant is an actual seargeant and implied vietnam vet who s negligence led to the death of her platoon and now watches from the window with binoculars for the approach of an unseen enemy jennifer is a phish fan who couldn t score a ticket to the new year s eve show and went insane & likes to scarf down nembutols and other barbituates when nobody is looking and likewise has hidden homicidal tendancies linked to her inability to find a bra judge cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with her own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes ms callingham is an aged poet who serves as a sort of soothsaying old hag from macbeth before the cat gets her tongue and danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control and who s antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies & murders that ultimately take place in this dark old creepy house in the middle of nowhere the house itself is a wonderful set with a threadbare early 1970 s decor that is remarkable in it s unremarkableness with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting the house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors twisting confined stairways secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas and of course the basement mentioned in the title    visited only once but boy it sure proves to be a doozy i love the frosted old freezer where sam keeps her stash of popsicles the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year & force us to swelter in the heat everyone is covered with beads of persperation and looks exhausted and even the ever cheerful sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening though she cannot understand what it all means and rosie h is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened and while ms holotik s limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her big revelation scene she s a great screamer when all hell starts to break loose and brownrigg indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated too bad the real show stealer is sam however and fans of what i have been taught to refer to as splatter cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale and there is something moving about how sam runs to the protection of her friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests she was one mean motha before her lobotomy or the film is cut in any event you won t be prepared for the ending the first time you see it even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all together except for one person rhea macadams  uproariously stereotyped old coot mrs callingham who seems to be inspired by the donald sutherland old woman character from the michael reeves  1964 christopher lee film castle of the living dead in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye who not only predicts the future but has the film s most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with ms holotik that runs something like this    it s really beautiful out here do you get out much mrs callingham asks holotik to which the old woman replies it s you who needs to get out hilarious and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get don t look in the basement is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin codefree dvd releases by companies like brentwood home video diamond entertainment vci and platinum disc corp s horror classics series i kind of like alpha video s sexily gorgeously decorated $6 release from 2003 dig through those bargain bins but make sure you get one with the 89 90 minute print contained therein an older 83 minute version is downright confusing due to some of the trims and you really need to see the ending credits as intended to bring this sick twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to it s end masterpiece maybe not compared to the exorcist or rosemary s baby but it is a very uniquely american horror film and a genuine classic of the drive in age that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something made with more than just a little bit of brain juice and not a penny more than they absolutely needed ***1 2 out of ****	1
755	charlotte beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full time nurse there she is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor is dr masters all she seems to be don t look in the basement is one of the best low budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me the acting is excellent my favorite performance being by betty chandler as allyson the nymphomaniac the chills just jump right off the screen you probably won t have to say it s only a movie it s only a movie it isn t that scary but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low budget horror genre which i do it is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed axe is another cheap film that is looked down upon maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn t have excellent effects and or isn t considered a classic doesn t have a chance with an audience but i think that after people see this movie they will see how important the low budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish	1
756	you ll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land it s not so much of a horror show but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors notice the judge who s about to put on the ax from behind the doctor brr r r r not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness but when you get a chance remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady get out get out and never ever come back don t you wish you haven t looked in the basement	1
757	if you love drive in cheeze from the early  70s you will just love this onehow could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum you can t crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination the film looks like it was shot inside someone s house for about $32065 for me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuffthe gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilkbut there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos like myselfhappysome horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happenthat s not the case herethe characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyablethere is never a dull moment from start to finishthe mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable i liked it so much that right after the end credits i watched it a second timeit s an absolute must see for any self respecting drive in horror nut 95 10 on the drive in freak o meterrequired viewing yea i love youi do love younow take your thorazine and put your clothes back onplease8	1
758	i was unsure what to expect from driving lessons  unsure whether rupert grint could carry such a role but within the first few minutes i was completely hooked all the way through the music acting and scenery were absolutely stunning julie walters as always gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress evie and rupert grint equally as goodgave a fantastic performance as the romantic ben right from the beginning i was forced into involuntary cringes bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as ben broke free from her controlling mother and fought for her friendship with her only friend evie a very controversial story probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time highly recommend to anyone seeking a good british film and an evening to kick back and just enjoy yourself	1
759	i had to get this movie since it didn t come to where i live i waited patiently and it was worth the wait i totally fell in love with this movie the chemistry between walters and grint you could see since they also worked together on the harry potter moviesthe woman who plays her overbearing righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is i think she did a great job playing the role i only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it lol but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down snickers i totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch rent this movie i do have to say that rupert really did a great job and it s nice to see that she s doing movies outside of harry pottereven though i totally love her as ron weasley the whole cast did a great job and i hope rupert continues to act outside of harry potter to broaden her skill	1
760	i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was perusing the shelves at a local rental store having just watched the latest harry potter installment i was intrigued by rupert grint and wanted to see more of her work reading the description on back about an overzealous evangelical christian do gooder and identifying as an evangelical christian myself i thought oooh¬Öthis should be interesting and so it was i found mr brock s story beautiful in both words and images and sadly enough all too familiar the contrast she drew between ben s parent s interpretations of what it means to be a christian was a poignant commentary on how christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them on the one hand we have ben s mom stating whatever happens behind these walls ben we re god s ambassadors we show the world a smiling face on the other hand is ben s dad discussing truth in her sermon at the beginning of the film at the end of her monologue she states the more a person parades their christianity for the benefit of others the less i am inclined to trust the christianity they claim god tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth now how you express that the way the manner the means at your disposal these things are of no consequence be you christian or atheist unless in your heart you are true if only our churches were full of christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of jesus rather than the former what a difference that would make as a christian and a psychologist i would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day what a tragedy ¬ñ to feel like i always need to play a role when really i just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who god made me to be i think mr brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in christ looks like i recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith	1
761	i thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoymentrupert grint played the part marvelously and has a general knack for the acting business the almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot and was a character one could almost instantly loathe this reminded me in a way of the divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood not by means of actual content of the film but the premises and overall tone to the film itself driving lessons is a coming of age story which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother the lack of freedom and the discovery of oneself	1
762	i thought it was going to be a lousy movie honestly i mean rupert grint ron acting in a movie different from harry potter was actually really difficult to picture it but as the movie started it showed that this guy does have talent i mean is the best actor of the hp trio for reference have you seen emma watson trying to act or what about daniel s acting both lack experience even though they have acted in a million harry potter movies ben her character is a very shy boy incapable of showing her true feelings about everything her despise about her over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards her father who is unable to step up and confront her unfaithful wife julie walters was absolutely brilliant her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past while she tries to remember shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful also it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts	1
763	this movie is a great film the movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film driving lessons centers around ben rupert grint a shy 17 year old who is coming of age the movie goes on about how ben is sick of her dominating mother and how she just wants to be herself ben then meets evie who she makes a very special bond with the two take a journey and in the process ben finds herself and what a relationship that she and evie share this is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else no matter what you will all feel what ben goes through in the movie it is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as ben s lessons	1
764	i being a fan of rupert grint rented this film a few months ago i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors it was entertaining and showed that rupert grint could play more than her most well known character of ron weasley her subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else s great acting made this film very likable ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job she finds one and becomes the i guess you could call assistant to evie a retired actress at first it is just a way for her to earn some money but after a while she and evie seem to develop a friendship evie helps ben break out of her shell a little and gets her to have fun and be happy with herself and in the end they both seem to need each other whether you are a fan of rupert grint or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors	1
765	i d heard about this movie but didn t see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to australia told me it was a great movie i was interested in seeing whether rupert grint away from harry potter was showing the promise you see in the potter movies i wasn t disappointed she s become a fine actor showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding herself to be worthy of her own and other s esteem going over lines from plays and poetry with her aging actress employer it s obvious that she s ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage but the jewel of this movie was julie walters i d seen her previously in the potter movies billy elliott and calendar girls and loved her in driving lessons as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare i was awed by her timing command of the language and body language i m hoping it was make up costuming as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis though no mention of it is made in the movie   as a nurse i can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old age but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a long time and i wish i d seen it in a theatre first   but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in albuquerque we miss out on so many of these types of movies here	1
766	i really only watched this movie because it had rupert grint in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can t wait to see more of rupert s films in the future julie walters also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn t quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame evie the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie	1
767	ben marshall a teen ager from a religious background is made aware about the financial situation at home by her domineering mother laura she suggests her to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household in fact the family has taken a widower to board with them robert marshall the father is a pastor at the local church she d much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to her church the job ben applies is with an older actress evie walton who wants her to do things for her around the house dame evie as she calls herself is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great in fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she d rather forget about it evie who is a compulsive liar tells ben she s dying only to forget it conveniently later on when she comes clean to the boy  ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of her employer she has been taking driving lessons evie asks her to take a camping trip which she does against her better judgment she knows that it will provoke her mother s fury not content with that evie decides to go on to edinburgh where she has been invited to read at an arts festival it is this trip that solidifies their bond ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic bryony when ben gets back everything crumbles at home her mother who has been having an affair with a parishioner decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with ben and evie s relationship survives the test of time she also begins to see her own father in a different light  jeremy brock the writer of driving lessons and other memorable english films takes her first directorial job with this engaging comedy the mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in her screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies we have seen the similar situation before as in billy elliott where julie walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man we had read the film was based on mr brock s own experience while working dame peggy ashcroft when she was young  julie walters who plays evie walton is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie she always delivers ms walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame laura linney a luminous player herself doesn t quite get our sympathy with her icy mother rupert grint famous for her harry potter s movies plays ben the young man who sees in evie a kind soul nicholas farrell is the betrayed father michelle duncan has a small role in which she shines	1
768	lovely i just love the movie i want to see this movie because rupert grint is a fantastic actor her expressions are great spectacular the movie was excellent julie walters it was perfect too i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love rupert have a beautiful smile a beautiful voice and a wonderful accent i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more she just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway it does not matter but she is perfect brilliant and beautiful	1
769	driving lessons is a little film that sneaks up on you what at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy british style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly writer jeremy brock  mrs brown   charlotte gray   the last king of scotland  here directs her own screenplay and the result is a cohesive progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters each performed by sterling actors ben marshall rupert grint standing firmly on her own as a developing actor post  harry potter  series is a quiet plain little poetic seventeen year old living with her bird watching vicar father nicholas farrell and her obsessive compulsive rigid evangelical do gooder mother laura linney in a home where  needy people  such as the murderous cross dressing mr fincham jim norton take precedence over family matters the mother is by the way having an affair with priest peter oliver milburn using ben as her cover sad ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car her mother is a poor teacher and decides she needs professional lessons and needs to get a job to help pay for poor mr fincham s needs ben follows an ad and meets dame eve walton julie walters an elderly has been actress who is as zany as any character ever created she hires ben and the fireworks begin through a series of incidents including a camping trip evie demands they take the two learn life s lessons missing from each other s natures ben learns self respect and self confidence and evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding julie walters always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates finds a role like no other here she is outlandishly wild and lovable rupert grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age ben the chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film  harold and maude  laura linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire and the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations this film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting   and message grady harp	1
770	after seeing the harry potter movies i ve been a fan of the trio actors rupert grint daniel radcliffe and emma watson yet we ve been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the jk rowling series mainly instead of a trio the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on daniel and emma being that they re the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving rupert dead end no matter every actor has a time to shine and rupert s light hits her for once in this movie driving lessons is called the harold and maude of this generation with rupert grint playing the role of ben marshall a young british lad who lives with her domineering mother laura linney and a wimp of a vicar priest father for which she wants a job in the summer but can t find work while at the same time taking her driving tests and failing and writing poetry for a young girl who doesn t have any interest in her ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady she takes the job and realizes that she s in for a fun of surprises as evie julie walters rupert s mother in the harry potter series an out of work actress who is also a poet giving ben the run for her money they bond where and tell each other secrets along with evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ben along for a country road trip from their not only does ben drive all the way from britain to scotland since evie needs to recite at a local library but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which ben starts becoming a man there is mishap and at the same time rejoice with ben and evie along with saying that i was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and i was impressed with rupert grint s acting especially if she showed the rest of the world that even though she brings a bit of ron weasley within ben marshall there s no stopping the actor on her brilliant performance	1
771	i ve felt that rupert grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows her so even though i had never heard of this film before when it appeared in my cable tv listings i immediately switched to that channel i am so happy that i did  i ve read from other reviewers that they don t generally like coming of age stories i on the other hand quite do i am one of those who is always coming of age i have been since i was 12 i m 52 now and i will probably continue until i m 92 coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings the suddenness of the realization the magnitude of it sometimes throws us into disarray if we try to shelter our delicate selves from that then yes i can see how the coming of age can end but if we simply dust ourselves off and settle into the new direction we ve discovered then we re all of a sudden on a new path and we re just as alive as we were yesterday only stronger brighter and i daresay more interesting  so that s what this movie was about this was a coming of age story all the way round young ben her father father robert and certainly dame evie all went through a marvelous transformation in fact so too did mr fincham didn t she all did i suspect except in fact the mother in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do provided by the events of the end of the film one is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she s been on only with perhaps a different supporting cast so an excellent film that could not possibly have been made in america which is utterly depressing to think about but thank god we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see i really heartily recommend this film so long as you don t mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all and grinning through all the rest of it	1
772	a beautiful film one that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed made me think about death but not fear it think about life but not hide from it a movie that gave both love for all i stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell a movie that made me think of love and all that i have lost but no sadness graced my eyes for some strange reason relief a child of two worlds god and theater and a good bit of wine and irony i most highly recommend ***** when the s*** hits the fan get a tent oh and we should all go camping every day	1
773	sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 1 2 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how she finds herself through her work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress very well acted especially by julie walters rupert grint plays the role of the teenage boy well showing her talent will last longer than the harry potter series of films laura linney plays her ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so there s no room to like her at all but the film is a very entertaining film made well by the british in the style of the likes of keeping mum and calendar girls	1
774	loved this movie what a hoot rupert and julie are great together with rupert being almost poker faced against julie s animation which worked well laura did a good job as the overbearing motherjulie of course is marvellous as usual while this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters interesting that it was entitled driving lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as ben finally being in the driving seat in her own life like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie very enjoyable movie and well worth watching	1
775	i watched this film on itv and i enjoyed it a lot it was very watchable and very funny julie walters and rupert grint were perfect in their roles julie walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch ben s character is kinda shy and stoic but the changes she goes through are wonderfully acted out by rupert grint i would definitely say she has a future in acting after harry potter laura linney is quite good in her role as ben s over protective mother the only thing they went wrong with is by making her toovillain y ben s father was also an interesting contrast to her mother and in the end she is quite honourable too the only character i wasn t keen on was bryony she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch one of my favourite films of the year easily	1
776	driving lessons sees two middle class quintessential british families meet head on when grint s character comes into contact with evee walters a slightly deranged out of touch actress with an ego grint betrays her overpowering and over christian mother linney and goes off travelling with evee to scotland to accompany her on a trip to participate in a poetry reading something she claims could be her last due to an illness grint s portrayal of a caged youngster brainwashed by an overbearing and even hypocritical mother is the masterpiece of this film her portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of her true morals and happiness is captivating to watch unfold throughout the film is sharply shot and well paced with very few moments leaving you tired an achievement particularly considering the nature of the plot walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands and successfully brings the audience to her side of things emphasising linney s ironic immorality throughout her role in driving lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sense the plot develops nicely leaving the audience cheering on grint as she chases back to evee s place during her lunch break during her stint at a local bookshop to apologise for her wrongdoings the values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag in a very consistent way the overbearing and relieving main idea being that religion doesn t lead to happiness and certainly doesn t lead to morality the audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable evee with her and grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen transferred directly from their debut in the harry potter series charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must see this christmas	1
777	i wasn t expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when she meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express her ideas with words she slowly but surely breaks out of her shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75% of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see	1
778	i caught the first screening of driving lessons at the tribeca film festival rupert grint shows she can act past harry potter laura linney is amazing as the overbearing mother julie walters is hilarious as dame evie walton with a mouth worse than a sailor i hope that this film is picked up by an american distributor so that everyone can see it this film is not only about driving lessons but life lessons ben rupert grint is torn between wanting to obey her overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live her own life it s an amazing film from an amazing director whose taken her own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see and everyone who can should	1
779	driving lessons from the writer of the critically acclaimed films mrs brown and charlotte gray jeremy brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring academy award nominees julie walters and laura linney and from the harry potter series rupert grint the beautiful portrait tells the story of ben marshall rupert grint a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of her religiously neurotic mother laura laura linney after her school year ends she decides to take a job with a clever free spirited and heavy on the bottle retired actress evie walton julie walters the pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life challenging the domineering mother as well as each other along the way the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives the comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the british veteran julie walters brock uses her unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream directing comes naturally to brock as she builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation even the subtle score by unknown composers clive carroll and john renbourn accentuate the tone and manner brock had no trouble in generating laura linney is always making her mark in films as she does as laura the bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona the complexity of her character couldn t have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else rupert grint breaks away from ron weasley and tries on someone new her performance is more responsive than loquacious but grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it but the standout is coming from oscar nominated actress julie walters who gives evie a life of her own despite the role being clearly a leading one walters fairs better in the supporting category where i believe she can simply take home the prize evie is a mix of clementine kruczynski and mrs laura henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards season driving lessons isn t an out of this world experience but a fine enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life love and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizes grade *** ****	1
780	i can t disagree with a previous comment that driving lessons is more than a little twee but one man s indictment is another s endorsement i suppose in my book this film succeeds on pure charm no small feat in itself i can t help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway julie walters  dame evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress though evie hasn t had steady work in years it s unclear the last time she visited reality if ever think edina from abfab at 65 at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch factor some may find her annoying but i think that s the point to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved ben s rupert grint buttons to force her out of her shell ben is equally isolated from reality living her whole life under the thumb of her overly dependent mother who laura linney manages to breath some life into despite being a fairly one dimensional character ye olde overbearing religious mom i was rather impressed with rupert grint who i found to give a very honest and believable performance not to mention sweet as all get out i can t think of many teen actors today for whom i can say that the heart of the movie is what happens when ben and evie s worlds collide at first ben is understandably tentative but also intrigued as evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything she s ever known with the combination of evie s persistence and ben s helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives ben her first real taste of independence the tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance a credit to the main actors all in all i d say that if you re willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances driving lessons shouldn t disappoint however if cute is not in your movie vocabulary best to stay away one other minor note the soundtrack features the music of sufjan stevens prominently a nice touch	1
781	i saw this tonight with moderate expectations   if tartan films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that s generally a good sign however i m not normally a fan of julie walters generally disliking her comedy roles sorry to any fans but it s a personal thing   i just don t find her funny in comedy this was magnificent though   a great performance by all but grint and walters are exceptional plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film   such a coming of age film wouldn t normally be something i d expect to like so much but i can t recommend this highly enough   and watch rupert grint as she matures into a fine fine actor	1
782	i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest i didn t know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly she s definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evie s rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with	1
783	a british twist on harold and maude driving lessons features a reined in rupert grint and an over the top julie walters while it is true that grint is stone faced like a redheaded benjamin braddock for the first half of the movie it does not deter from the quirky family film  there are things going on that are out of her character s experience that would create a shell shocked reaction the chemistry between walters and grint carries the film though laura linney s hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable these performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like sufjan stevens john renbourn and salsa celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a saturday afternoon	1
784	i just saw this movie at the tribeca film festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing the combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile the movie was about a seventeen year old boy whose mother and father are very religious the seventeen year old ben decides to work for a retired actress who teaches her about girls and driving and life it is very comical and touching i honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone if you didn t catch one of the showings at the film festival it s supposed to come out in theaters later in the year please go see it it is a great film	1
785	well i m an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such argento fulci bava sr and bava jr only to quote the most famous la villa delle anime maledette is one of the most unknown movie of this genre shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today and director carlo ausino sounds totally new to my ears althoug she directed six movies this is the price italian directors have to pay to not work in rome  but the film is not so bad and it s absolutely not correct to talk about trash ok the plot is not so original it reminds me stuff like the amytville series the year is the same of amityville possession by damiano damiani or shock the last work of mario bava but you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer like mario bava movies so the most important thing is the atmosphere not the story or the characters atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement the rest remain in the background i think the movie works not so good but works it s surely better than a lot of hollywoodian production like the haunting which have a bigger budget but not bigger ideas	1
786	a buster keaton silent short poor buster becomes the goat scapegoat for a dangerous escaped murderer this is a wonderful hilarious little film with keaton at her absolute best in what is essentially a series of chases buster gets to exercise her endlessly inventive imagination big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief born into a family of vaudevillian acrobats buster keaton 1895 1966 mastered physical comedy at a very early age an association with fatty arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic silent feature length films   all from 1920 to 1928 writer director star & stuntman   buster could do it all and her intuitive genius gave her almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience more akin to fairbanks than chaplin buster s films were full of splendid adventure exciting derring do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable her theme of a little man against the world who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity dominates her films through every calamity & disaster buster remained the great stone face a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad in the late 1920 s buster was betrayed by her manager brother in law and her contract was sold to mgm which proceeded to nearly destroy her career teamed initially with jimmy durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath her talent finally before lung cancer took her at age 70 she had the satisfaction of knowing that her classic films were being rediscovered now well past her centenary buster keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema s true authentic geniuses and she knew how to make people laugh	1
787	buster keaton was arguably at her most enjoyable when she did short 20 minute films and they don t come more rib ticklingly funny than this gem the dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix up with a wanted felon this leads to her elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the her face from the wanted signs the goat is choc a bloc with brilliant site gags from the opening scene at the bread queue right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end a keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking as sound is never something you needed with her her movies explain themselves through the wonderful yet incredibly dangerous things she did to herself it isn t hard to see just how influential she really was   the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as she was in 1921	1
788	this is a wonderful comedy short  one of keaton s absolute best through a long series of silly mistakes buster is mistaken for a wanted killer and as a result most of the film consists of her running from the cops and one detective in particular while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability i have seen some that have had wilder stunts but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace in particular there is a scene where she runs across a table jumps on a man s shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed such as how she really comes to believe that she s actually killed someone by the way this film is very similar to cops also by keaton but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the playhouse  where buster plays every role at the theater	1
789	saw this for the first time on uk tv with good musical accompaniment the elevator scene is class especially when she does the going down thing in the phone booth and then fiddles with the floor indicator the jump through the transom is really impressive and there s so much more apart from all the stuff that s been mentioned before there s the fight with the man who s been bullying the woman with the dog   it just looks so simple the only drawback is the plot   she gets mixed up with dead eye dan who then escapes but doesn t reappear even when some more gangsters get involved later on the scene where it looks like she s shooting at the fat inspector is funny but would have been better if dead eye was the one pulling the trigger	1
790	there is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail think of that conman s conman wcfields in the old fashioned way or the marx brothers in a night at the opera or chaplin in the adventurer of mae west in she done her wrong the skirting of the law is inevitable and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic think of lloyd in her first talkie welcome danger trying to assist the san francisco police department in the midst of a crime wave and making police sergeant edgar kennedy want to kill her think of laurel and hardy as ill fated cops in midnight patrol i find this type of hostility is so patent in all these giants  and their peers  comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it think of jerry seinfeld in one episode of her series creating a three stooges short sappy pappies where the boys end up being electrocuted for murder buster keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be her opponents in her comedies look at steamboat bill jr where she tries to spring her dad from a calaboose but she actually had more conflict from police forces in her shorts in convict 13 she is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict in cops perfect title   if you see it you d understand the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for keaton mistaken for a terrorist and in the goat she is unable to avoid the police for most of the film keaton is a tramp just looking for food but she is totally unlucky when she sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe which keaton earlier ignored over her shoulder and then find a wallet full of money keaton tries the same thing and hits a cop in the head the cop gives chase and keaton as luck would have it runs into another cop tries to act normal but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first soon she has three cops chasing her briefly shaking them she walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer dead shot dan malcolm st clair* is being photographed passing in back of the barred windows keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in the desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken when dead shot flees the police it is keaton s face on all the wanted posters *st clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies although in her later biography would be a stint at 20th century fox where her work with laurel & hardy was below par keaton flees to another town by train disconnecting the passenger cars containing her pursuers from the locomotive and tender this is the film by the way that has two famous keaton jokes her arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot with it coming closer and closer and suddenly the audience sees keaton sitting on the cowcatcher  the second famous sequence goes later and may have influenced chaplin somewhat in the beginning of city lights keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog virginia fox when she sees the poster s calling her a murderer she thinks she killed the man she is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police joe roberts and momentarily loses roberts in the park a statue of man of war is being constructed and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse keaton is seen seated on the clay model trying to maintain her dignity as the clay legs of the horse start collapsing under her weight  keaton manages to meet the pretty ms fox who invites her home for dinner only she doesn t realize her father is roberts the last five minutes of the film deal keaton fleeing and avoiding roberts while she and fox get away together it s a funny comedy and a wonderful example of keaton s work at her best	1
791	this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of her films in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster   her creativity the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there	1
792	to my eternal shame i ve never seen a silent movie   not even the mother of all vampire movies nosferatu however if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from buster keaton then i ll probably try to watch a few more this is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies the premise such as it is focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as keaton is mistaken for renowned bad guy dead shot dan co director malcolm st clair this leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate keaton you re left amazed and entertained in equal measures keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt man judging by the way she leaps and jumps around like jackie chan on speed and the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard   my better half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much if you ve never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch   it certainly blew away any ideas i may have had about silent films naturally it isn t as polished as today s movies   the acting is pretty awful truth be told but that doesn t matter because you re enjoying the movie regardless anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed brilliant	1
793	not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal  there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off buster s physical talents which are amazing and her comedic timing the 27 minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero earlier it s a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it s big joe roberts a rotund cop   and father a girl buster is interested in   who chases her those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and her daughter live that was keaton at her best it s just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares it s buster at her slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool	1
794	this metro film is episodic but nearly a constant series of chases mainly trying to escape police whether real or imagined as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal it is consistently inventive and entertaining its greatest value is in its documenting what hollywood looked like in the early twenties since 95% of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it   with buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close up within seconds the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator   one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor   one of the great keaton gags kino s print is sharp and clear   almost pristine there is a violin piano score accompaniment this is one to seek out and enjoy	1
795	along with cops the goat is one of keaton s two funniest shorts which makes it one of the best shorts ever made this has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict how the mistake happens is a classic and then must elude the authorities best gags   the bread line and t she elevator	1
796	i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of her powers and must certainly rank with the half dozen best short comedies ever made the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags two reels of non stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending    which wasn t always the way with buster s comedies see cops for one case where fatalism ultimately got the better of her or one week for the victory of defeatism if i had to describe this film in one word i d call it effortless but if i were permitted two i d call it seemingly effortless for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease still they didn t call her the great stone face for nothing buster never let the public see her sweat a sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along millionaires  row ie on a bread line in a grim urban setting where buster waits patiently at the back of the line and as a result doesn t get fed but it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does she play for pathos buster has our sympathy but she never asks for it before long through a series of accidents coincidences and absurd misunderstandings buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while she s clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self pity or even surprise we get the sense she always knew that this is what life would have in store for her and that she hasn t time to feel sorry for herself anyway she has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap just as buster refrains from playing for sympathy she never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laugh packed short comedies in existence this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a train s cow catcher right up to the very lens of the camera which isn t a gag exactly but sure is laugh provoking in its own strange way meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly furry mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under buster s weight a surreal sight indeed but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when buster is trying to elude her primary nemesis big joe roberts a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox trapped in big joe s dining room buster leap frogs over her and sails through a transom turns a phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid herself of her pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade out gag to say more would be a disservice to first time viewers i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people who d never seen it before and float on the laughter live musical accompaniment would be nice too and incidentally the musical score supplied by kino for their home video dvd version of the goat is first rate serving as icing on an already tasty cake	1
797	ok i am a huge traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 85+ rating but even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an hbo movie but i am afraid if you take traci out of the movie it would just be ok but a person can t do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress she just keeps getting better and better	1
798	i really like traci lords she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she s rather good in this she play the dowdy conservative reporter to a  t  it s a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while jeff fahey is also good as traci s boss i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress she s certainly no worse than some of today s leading ladies	1
799	a very good offering from hbo traci lords is becoming a much better dramatic actress with each effort i hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future instead of the flighty roles she has been stuck with in the past	1
800	good film i managed to pick this up on dvd in a local store sale ¬£299 seems like a good deal and it is thing is the film is named to kill for it took a little detective work to find out it s original name in the uk it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell having seen final destination 3 last night it in my view should have been a 18 maybe the fact the delightful traci lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18 such a shame traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions she ability to turn what is branded a b movies into a fine performance is nothing short of amazing long live traci lords and her incredible talent as an actress	1
801	in extramarital we see b actress traci lords at her very best she s all wrapped in horror & suspense here a type of role that suits her very well this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven s  basic instinct  1992 by the way however there are differences between the main female characters of traci lords  99 and that of sharon stone  92 for instance in extramarital traci adds some tiny elements from her porn past we also shouldn t forget mentioning extramarital s three main actors by putting down a convincing performance each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie  all this makes extramarital into a very enjoyable b movie its storyline shows a good build up its tense being well spread from start to finish this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until its unexpected end	1
802	the movie was very good i m an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn t figure out who did it i wasn t happy with the portrayal of the gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that  cloying  please know that while these poirot movies are good they just don t have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don t have japp ms lemon and especially hastings david suchet is definitely poirot i have seen every actor who s played her the worst was peter ustinov	1

804	just after having moved into her new cottage in the english country hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell the owners of a large mansion nearby but the next day one of the guests is found shot near the pool and her clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away this agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin though the killer s plan is still very clever it s the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of five little pigs and sad cypress but contains more dark humor than them the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point edward fox as the butler and sarah miles as lady angkatell though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead of her time henrietta her one on one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film oh and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one ***	1
805	this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of  the hollow  it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie s best but what makes  the hollow  special is the characterisation and i found the actors here more or less without exception were perfect in their parts in such a uniformly good cast it s difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy s dottiness tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact lucy is not really all that nice megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what her women see in her as i said the script follows the story quite faithfully the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward s relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done the whole thing looks beautiful as well really capturing a perfect english autumn its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing	1
806	this movie deserves a 20 10 if i could give one the hollow is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel there was no major difference that i could spot the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel the acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality david suchet is perfect in her role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either in no other movie that i ve seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly hats off to the producers   they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come	1
807	excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife gerda claire price as well of course as david suchet i did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point the ending which i won t divulge someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else s question if you are interested i found really sad despite agatha christie s reputation for writing cardboard characters i thought these really well rounded by and large the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward hardwicke cedric s son i believe in addition to being a well known dr watson as her husband	1
808	david suchetpoirotfoolproof 03 gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything she did or said if she had a cocktail she always had a napkin to blot the excess on her mouth with unbelievable perfection you could just view the expressions on the detective s face and see that she never missed an item of importance in the suspects behavior the beautiful falls colors through out the english countryside was simply breath taking megan dodds bait2000 gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from mr poirot a very enjoyable film if you really like the acting of david suchet as mr poirot	1
809	in a better civilization this and many other of the david suchet movies would be released in theaters the plots are fabulous no i d no clue who had done it but the clues were all there if i d been more imaginative   the best kind of mystery the production values astounding the acting from edward fox sarah miles lysette anthony megan dodds and of course david suchet as hercule poirot simply perfect the dialogue wonderful the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff one of the pleasures of these hercule poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them here were have two   the sexy sinuous megan doods and the stunning lysette anthony you really can t go wrong renting these   they re just wonderful   like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine   your mind constantly working because it s all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything   and the settings gorgeous i can t think of movies that stimulate thought more than these hercule poirot david suchet movies it s impossible to over praise them   and i had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an agatha christie	1
810	the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course poirot it  s set on a country house on a weekend as always all the guests are suspects and it s up to poirot to figure out the truth with movies like this it s always best not to give too much away so i ll stop here what i loved in the `hollow  was that it s a mystery the old fashioned way when poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example everybody seems to be the culprit there s that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story you can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience the actors are all very good as a curiosity notice edward hardwicke who played dr watson in sherlock holmes nice to see her after a few years suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time i did find out who the murderer was but still it s not predictable and it s also very believable so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure 	1
811	i first saw this movie back in the early 90 sand instantly fell in love with itrichard benjamin and her wife paula made the 1981 movie saturday the 14thin 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983i think they work quite well togetherthis movie made me laugh on several occasionsit also has a young molly ringwaldwho would later go on in the late 1980 s to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candlesit is fun watching her a little youngeralthough not seen by many peoplei don t even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this moviebut when i first came acrossed it i was glad i didi gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoylastly i would like to say its not available on dvdso i picked up a vhs copy on ebayso if your interestedyou probably can find one on thereit might be in the $20 $30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucksi wish they would eventually release this on dvd	1
812	and i m so disappointed because i can t seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere its a kind of mix of uncle buck and the great outdoors and molly ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager this was made when molly was still a brunette just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink i d definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with an edge  if anyone has a copy of this or knows where i can get oneplease leave a message for me   it ll be much appreciated	1
813	this has to be one of the funniest movies i ve ever seen the idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness when mom and dad both lose there jobs not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub they decide it s in their families best interest to move to oregon once there everything goes wrong an interesting cast of characters compliment this movie including a young molly ringwaldthis a movie i would definetly recommend	1
814	the story is about a working girl ann sothern who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend paul kelly this boyfriend is so busy trying to start her own business that again and again she forgets dates or shows up late the final straw is when sothern has a birthday and kelly says she s too busy to take her out to celebrate so not wanting to just stay home she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man neil hamilton sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after sothern breaks off her relationship with kelly that new boyfriend hamilton is a love  em and leave  em sort of guy how all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict  just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly this is a very modest little film from columbia pictures  with a relatively small budget as well as second tier stars it s clearly a b movie despite there being small roles played by a mickey rooney and jane darwell  as both had yet to become famous now this is not to say that these are bad actors or the production isn t any good in fact given the production values this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline that s because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them the ending in particular is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing because of these factors the film earns a 7 of 10	1
815	blind date is one of three stories made into movie by author vida hurst lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934 mickey rooney as a mouthy little punk she seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values jane darwell again plays the strong willed mother just as she had in grapes of wrath and the oxbow incident ann sothern is kitty who has been dating bill paul kelly but meets up with rich bob hartwell played by neil hamilton who may or may not be better for her you can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the hays production code    at one point kitty says she can t be up there alone with her if there isn t anyone else in the housewhat a change from just a year or two prior when anything and everything was ok good solid plot but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk it raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice or just find a man with big bucks as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated and how do men change when their situation changes  watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene tv viewers from the 1960s will recognize hamilton as commissioner gordon from batman also some weird drama in the off screen lives for some of the cast in this one   paul kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle mickey rooney had an affair with norma shearer who was 20 years older rooney ended up being married eight times tyler brooke emory and spencer charters pa both knocked themselves off in real life the title blind date has been reused many times for films tv series and even cartoons but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one	1

817	i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo drafthouse in austin she prefaced it with how freaking awesome she thought she was and how funny it was and in the context of her explanation it was hilarious i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i d pee they don t come until after the halfway point but when they do oh godyou will die oh and jim brown is brilliant she s not in a lot of the movie but when she s there you know whose movie it is naturally the best line in the movie and the funniest is her you ll know it when you hear it	1
818	this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 s exploitation film except it was done in the late 80 s for the direct to video market you have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence when the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because she owes drug lord jim brown money she becomes brown s property then she s basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for as if this isn t enough reason to see this movie you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor but she s really a major crack dealer in a sleazy yet hilarious scene she demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix in an earlier scene it was established that she is her counselor that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film tarantino bring her back it s not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this it has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs jim brown s villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80 s b villain wings hauser in vice squad sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged in the meantime let s hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor	1
819	crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80 s that falls into this genre what s supposed to be an anti drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white exploitation exercise in depravity there s nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an anti drug message from one of the stars of the show richard turncoat roundtree the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is her girl one of them get s turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at her ex friends jim brown appears as the movie s mister big she s one bad dude who still can punk out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack her hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy her word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie s for you sadly hollywood doesn t make these any more and when they do it s neither exploitative nor entertaining recommended for sleaze fans	1
820	when i first got wind of this picture it was just called shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put jcvd back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff i was very well excited about the whole piece by the time it was titled the shepherd border patrol i was tap dancing in excitement for this flick with isaac fluorentine at the helm of directing and jj perry pulling stunt coordination i almost peed me pants in anticipation pics were released of jcvd kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as scott adkins playing what i thought was the villain and i was mind blown in excitement i thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like lone wolf mcquade then it came out i ordered it off blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything the reviews from vandammefannet kinda had my ideas alittle altered but i braced myself the mail came on day 4 and i ripped open the package my initial plan was to rush upstairs rip the face off the cardboard packaging then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my dvd player however i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film by the time it was over i was cool as a fool in the pool the shepherd is certainly one of my all time favorite direct to video films ever and makes derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is sure some of the fights ran a twee bit short but they were still very awesome the shootouts were superb as was scott adkins who should have been the villain unlike the forgettable steven lord i highly recommend this flick seriously	1
821	van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes this movie was amazing the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america usa van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain although this film wasn t as good as until death but it still gave the actionacting and the film a five star look i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better keep them coming van damme watch this film if you enjoyed films like   until death the hard corps and second in command	1
822	this movie was made on a relatively small budget 10 20 million dollars with almost no promotion at all from its distributors i only knew about it because i am a long time jean claude van damme fan and i always check out her latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys derailed second in command they are this movie has an easy enough plot to follow and van damme gives a good humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving van damme scott adkins and the final one of them together the editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but isaac florentine can definitely film a good fight scene i too am happy that van damme has been acting better lately in hell wake of death until death but with the good acting came less martial arts in the shepherd van damme proves that she still has it	1
823	i like the shepherd sure the acting wasn t good but the fight scenes were nice van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins the story was average a texas cop battles smugglers this movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action van damme was never a good actor i think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2 if you re looking for an oscar winning performance you re not gonna get it here but if you re looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but her movies in this movie are great van damme delivers strong kicks and it s good to see her performing martial arts again since she has not in her last 4 or 5 movies this movie is definitely worth watching if you re a van damme fan	1
824	i have not seen a van damme flick for a while pleasantly surprised she still has it looking older but tougher kind of like sly becomes more rugged with age this is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the van damme movies i have missed over the last ten years i would like to see a good director put van damme on the big screen with a good plot van damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences the last movie viewed with van damme was legionnaire that was a good flick as well in addition i looked in to van damme s early fighting history i too my amazement i realized she is the real deal very accomplished martial artist in her younger years	1
825	after 10 years it is finally save to say that our belgian action star is back again i personally found this one to be even better than wake of death which makes it her best movie in 10 years okay it is not like her highlight years as timecop universal soldier sudden death or even her best effort to date hard target one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors john woo the action is good the story is exciting the dialogue is quite funny this one is better than expectedthe bad guys are awesome like in hard target and the fight scenes are old school real fans know what to expect i must say i gave up on her but van damme is finally back more please	1
826	like steven seagal i also am a big van damme fan and have followed most of her movies since the start of her acting career in this flick van damme assumes the role of jack robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to new mexico from new orleans to work as part of the border patrol haunted by memories of her past it is up to jack to put an end to a group of ex navy seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the us that killed her daughter overall i found this film to be very good van damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move the action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing unfortunately van damme does not have the same intensity as she did say 10 years ago regardless the shepherd border control is the 3rd straight solid film that van damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project i definitely recommend this movie to a van damme fan or fan of action movies in general the shepherd border control is a great movie not as good as until death but better than the hard corps be sure to give this one a try you will not be disappointed	1
827	i thought that this was the most interesting film that jcvd has done in a very long time i loved her character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film imho jcdv may really be on to something going forward a little more light heartedness some obvious homages to other films mixed in with some great fightsi would like to see more this style of film making from her one of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a desperado rip off i immediately saw the r rodriguez connection also but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films jcvd rocks other stuff after reading other comments no music in the dungeon fight at first i didn t like that at first either but then i thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn t expect made it seem more real i also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio directors are paid to do a job the studio is the boss and they want the product that they want very few directors have absolute final cut on a film in this case jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film i am sure she got a film that she was happy with i have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story presumably the director worked on and delivered her cut of the film everyone who saw it said it was a disasterthen jcvd and the studio re edited the movie this stuff happens all the time she also did see the final cut which she claims she didn t and her delicate genius ego was severely bruised because they hated her delivered cut if this director was smart she should have taken credit for this one as it would have been her best	1
828	it s really good to see van damme s film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c grade flops derailed and second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way the sheperd border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action fight sequences it s good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as her last film until death had no martial arts in it at all that being said this film is significantly inferior to until death which was a really good turn for van damme until death lacked the over the top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van damme s performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film still the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you re looking for a film with a bit more story lineyou may want to skip this one i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on the only real problem i have with this film is the title the shepherd i don t get it i suppose border patrol just doesn t have the same ring to it without the word shepherd in front of it my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that s by van damme movie standards not in any other film category ie it s good for a van damme film	1
829	wellit s about time van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that s her best film in recent years the plot isn t too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex marines as drug smugglers twist is cool but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again her latest films have been more acting oriented but in the shepard jcvd is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows she can still pull out the old famous 360 spinning heel kick for being a low budget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts van damme says some humorous lines and shows that she s improving as an actor i m glad she s back to dealing out some van damagei ve been let down by the lack of fighting in her recent films scott adkins is great in her role and van damme and her have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end overall it s one of van damme s better films and it will keep you entertained a must rent for jcvd fans i m just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like bloodsport or kickboxer nok su kow	1
830	i enjoyed it there you go i said it again i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america van damme moves well for a guy of her age47 i think delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer if you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch this is one of van damme s best works van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen	1
831	this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme s best costar scott adkins shows why she should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed 2 adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating her on screen van damme holds her own though and although she isn t quite as athletic as adkins is she can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van damme s character s motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why she carries around a rabbit the reason she does is very cool but you don t find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain t character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border	1
832	this film is good in it s genre and that genre is naturally action with a little average budget looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when she has a good director guiding her there is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting some basic drama but nothing too deep isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it but the person who steals the show is  scott adkins how come this guy isn t a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i don t know director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed 2 check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and she needs to get it now what else can i say about the movie it s van damme stepping up a notch from some of her most recent work no oscars here for sure but you already knew that but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time so i m giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it s genre	1
833	after seeing undisputed 2 i knew what to expect from isaac florentine the shepherd border patrol is a decent flick not van damme s best but definitely not her worst there is some bad acting from vd s supporting cast but it makes sense the storyline and plot has all been done before so it s nothing new i mean this is van damme we don t really expect much of an amazing plot do we so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting without giving anything away i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of vd s recent movies such as second in command in which the entire end fight is horrible with florentine behind the camera and if you ve seen undisputed 2 she seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of vd s older stuff which is what we all want to see the fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought undisputed 2 was something i found intriguing was vd s daughter in the film i thought wow she s kinda hot come to find out its bianca van varenberg jc s real life daughter i have never seen her before so that was a nice treat all in all this movie is not half bad yeah the story has been done before but at least jc was attempting to make a good movie next time though add more hand to hand combat i think she still has what it takes to do another big budget moviehis acting has improved since she s been doing dtv s and she really is in great shape at 47 i don t know about you but i m one of the ones who thinks that most of her dtv s are actually good with the exception of derailed all she needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movieand i think people would respond well even though she s not jet li this movie is definitely worth the rental =	1
834	well it is a good movie however you have to admit that van dame s movies haven t been so great lately on the other hand if you are a hardcore van dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes also what i really liked is the music beautiful music am sure this will kill time if you are action fan as for isaac florentine the director of undisputed 2 i don t think she did a good job as she did with undisputedi cant wait when one day van dame s movies hit the cinemas before the dvd maybe one day in the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch this could make your hour and half fun	1
835	the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece the first sequel jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though it s still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still she s managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it again the action focuses on nami matsushima aka scorpion and this time she s out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back after escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother  while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison but scorpion doesn t like spending time behind bars and it s not long before she s back to doing what she does best the film gets off to a great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail from there however the film slows down a lot and beast stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films that s not to say that there isn t still plenty of action   scorpion still spends a lot of time in  revenge mode  and the film isn t exactly short on general sleaze meiko kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it s another understated almost wordless performance her screen presence is great however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film there s a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point overall i would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality   not as great as the original and slightly better than the second	1
836	since the past couple of days i m really hooked on the female scorpion series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now ¬ñ which is way too long ¬ñ before purchasing the whole box set beast stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles the original more or less qualified as a so called women in prison flick but already an atypical one but you can t possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls and the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well the first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic don t let this last description discourage you however as beast stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance the opening sequence for example is downright fantastic sasori still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there s no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her her run through the city with the cut off arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold the story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply can t escape her past or even new types of agony sasori befriends a prostitute though without exchanging dialog and takes on a job in a sewing atelier her own retarded brother  impregnates the prostitute while sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network she cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion meanwhile the one armed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets looking for retribution against sasori our multi talented director shunya ito formidably criss crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style beast stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing those who know sasori s character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely compensated with meiko kaji s wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces there s very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words in fact i think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far my only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when sasori is locked up in a cage that bird sounds like a ventriloquist s dummy with stomach cramps	1
837	after finishing the zero woman series i was looking forward to the female prisoner scorpion series both based upon comics by tooru shinohara unfortunately i was not able to see them in order as this is the third in the series it starts great as the scorpion meiko kaji is escaping from the police detective kondo mikio narita did manage to get a cuff on her but she proceeded to cut off her arm and get away if that isn t bad enough later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy her treat scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside first a local yakuza tanida v threatens to put her back if she doesn t put out and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of tanida but they don t hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance soon they are dropping like flies some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder the madam reisen lee turns herself in to avoid getting killed the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer she s in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend yayoi watanabe has been supplying her with food the story o yuki watanabe and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but only incidental to the movie they try to burn her out but this is the scorpion and she has some unfinished business not the usual mix of sex and violence this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout	1
838	there s hell to pay when you cross nami matsushimameiko kaji female scorpion and a dangerous group of thugsincluding their sadistic head pimp and her equally repellent lady operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist does just that hell hath no fury like scorpion and a determined detective gondomikio narita seeking revenge for decapitating her arm after handcuffing her will do whatever it takesand that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereaboutsto catch nami nami finds an ally in hooker yukiyayoi watanabe who provides her a temporary shelter yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of himin a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides her sexual needsshe in actuality keeps her locked up in a room while working the streets meanwhile nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her ownshe works as a sewer and she threatens to turn her into the authoritiesnami was an escaped convict who fled a subway from the copsif she doesn t supply her sexual favors her wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over her face and body resulting in death & the prostitution clan come looking for nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization that s when katsureisen lee the pimp s lover and confidant realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers scorpion subduing her with an injected liquid drug placing her in a bird cage katsu embellishes in her imprisonment what ultimately fuels nami s rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced late term abortion left to bleed to death finding a scalpel clutched in her handfrom the operation room nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker s death the series of scalpel murders provide gondo with an opportunity to catch nami and she ll trap her in the underground sewers below the city but can she catch or kill her especially if yuki comes to her aid trust me when i say there was no shackles binding director shunya ito or her film making team because female prisoner scorpionbeast stable is yet another perverse deranged and ultra violent entry in the very entertaining series equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways ito pulls you rightor she did meinto the twisted drama that always exists when nami matsushima is on screen when you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man s severed arm handcuffed to her the viewer has to know what they re in for the incestuous sub plot is simply bizarreand it s shot in a soft core way with the retarded brother humping her numb cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through but the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for nami s revengedespite nami s imperfect ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa interesting angle with detective gondo as well gondo is willing to break the rules and she becomes a force of nature towards anyone who stands in her way of capturing her mortal enemy her fate at the end visiting another enemy of nami s in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining the scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags in various places the blades protruding from flesh with nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances while the film is essentially a comic book adventure there s a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws i imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic female prisoner scorpionbeast stable isspecifically how nami is able to escape capture time and time again accomplishing her goals of revenge paying back all those who have wronged her but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80 s films and enjoyed it for what it was as always this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful heavies meiko kaji almost always reserved quiet yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine formin more ways than oneand reisen lee as her cross eyed repugnant adversary runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological tormentwhen both are in prison nami s ways of torturing her are sweet my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering gondo s rotted severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it	1
839	the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series  star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner #701 scorpion is one of my all time favorites the sequel jailhouse 41 is nearly as good it s generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp701 it s much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but there s more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops her arm off ¬ñ and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofy looking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yuki s story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and ito s direction is masterful it s too bad that she never went anywhere after she left the fp701 series this is an awesome film	1
840	many consider beast stable to be the last of the true female prisoner films as it is the last of the series directed by shunya ito and is followed by one other film grudge song by a different director i have not seen grudge song yet but soon will so i don t know how it stacks up to the previous fp films   but it will be interesting to see the way beast stable ended didn t really leave a lot of room for another predecessor   but i guess i ll find out this entry has scorpion on the run from the cops where she hooks up with a street hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child oh yeah   that s no liegotta love these sleazy story lines scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival but as she is so good at ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends i agree with some other reviewers that this one is a little slower at points and more serious then the previous two entries the story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times but a lot of these 70 s era pinky films are   and i still love them beast stable is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing   but i thought it strong in other areas   storyline cinematography some good sleazeetcdefinitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing or who have enjoyed the other female prisoner films8 10	1
841	female convict scorpion   beast stable the third in the series is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze closer in tone and subject to a nikkatsu violent pinker than other scorpion entries it is stunningly photographed directed with lurid enthusiasm and populated with a rogue s gallery of villains and degenerates shinya ito the director of the first installment returns for this surreal fable which begins with scorpion meiko kaji cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist she takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother who ends up impregnating her scorpion s desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose she is beaten sexually assaulted and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain s lair i loved everything about this hypnotic nihilistic and emotionally touching movie it is the superior of the three first scorpion films and features one great scene after another i can t recommend it highly enough	1
842	the third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant exploitation movies and the third masterpiece in a row joshuu sasori kemono beya aka female prisoner scorpion beast stable aka sasori den of the beast where i live of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects but that equals or arguably even surpasses them in brilliance the entire original sasori series with the wonderful meiko kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in wip cinema and all of the films especially the first three uniquely combine exploitation and art house cinema like no other movie does beast stable is the third and second to last sasori film with meiko kaji the last one to be directed by genius director shunya ito and in my opinion the greatest of them all the first film joshuu 701 g√¥ sasori of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of exploitation cinema and simply the definition of exploitation art in the equally brilliant first sequel joshuu sasori dai 41 zakkyo b√¥ ito added more surrealism and symbolism the third sasori film beast stable keeps up the surrealism allthough not quite to the same extent as the second and features even more social criticism than its predecessors topics like poverty forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie  this third sasori film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the generally brilliant cycle to me it s this one with the first one as a close second once again best stable is both very artistic and very exploitation like the visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty the stunningly beautiful meiko kaji is once again brilliant in her role of nami matsushima aka sasori i absolutely worship this wonderful actress and i m sure i m not the only one to do so the rest of the performances are also great especially mikio narita is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching sasori the musical score is the same throughout all three films with urami bushi sung by meiko kaji herself as the main theme which is great since the score is simply put pure perfection as its predecessors beast stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of exploitation art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss the entire sasori cycle ranges high on my personal all time favorite list beast stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all 10 10	1
843	i have been looking forward to the release of this dvd and it s follow up {female prisoner scorpion #701 s grudge song} for some time i very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series after just watching this film i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three  all three of these movies were directed by shunya ito what is great about them though is that even though they all feature the same lead character wonderfully played by meiko kaji they are each vastly different from the others  the first movie female prisoner #701 scorpion is more or less a typical women in prison movie but the character of scorpion is very intriguing   very reminiscent of the anti heroes of many spaghetti westerns and the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material  the second movie female convict scorpion jailhouse 41 is a real tour de force not so much a wip movie as the bulk of the film has scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam  this movie female prisoner scorpion beast stable is the third in the series and the last one directed by shunya ito this one plays out as much more of a crime drama once again our heroine is on the run but this time out she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life relatively speaking anyway she gets a job she finds a place to live she makes a friend on the outside but of course everything has to unravel eventually fps beast stable has a more straight forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors but i found it to be engaging from beginning to end and don t worry there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie but i think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in your face shock value yes there were definitely moments in this movie where i cringed mightily but i didn t feel that they detracted from the value of the story well maybe a time or two one thing i have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build up of scorpion s mythos with this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two we get to see that she is much more than just a stone hearted vengeful badass as i mentioned earlier in this review a fourth movie followed it also features meiko kaji as scorpion but had a different director without giving anything away i want to mention that fps beast stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary the fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind blowing trilogy i would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out of the ordinary films fps beast stable can be enjoyed as a stand alone piece as can the first two movies but i would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so	1
844	i loved this show i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show wasn t the shop located like right on the beach or something i actually wrote back and forth with marci for several years i lost touch and wish i could reconnect now as adults anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place they just don t make shows like this anymore do they i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd s of the show they taped on vhs i d be willing to paywithin reason	1
845	i m sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people the series started off very good and after the first season it wasn t that good people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end this is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result it is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but damn we had a lot of nice new characters please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series the plot please do understand that i didn t like it when boone died when augur died but well it needs to be done can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time come on face it if they didn t die they would be invincible in this way you will always keep the tension will she survive will she die i do realize that people attach their selves to characters i do that too my favorite character was augur the one who could get into every computer she wanted she was the one who was mysterious she could do things with the computer no one else could do i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating should we look at the final season instead of the total should we not see how good the series was when it started should we not see how much we enjoyed it	1
846	believe me i wanted this series to work but the early departure of kevin kilner dealt a near death blow after season one robert leeshock just wasn t right for the part and jane heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point i don t know what happened in season five what a mess sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull if you know what i mean the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict if not for their talents and well written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man chicks in a b movie series if only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by syfy	1
847	ok everybody agreed on what was the best season the first and killing off boone was a bad desicion also killing off others was bad blame the directors and writers for it bad boys but i still think this is the best scifi series ever sorry guys i can t help it i see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season still it s easy to accept liam as the new main character if you are over boone she is really mysterious the thing that shocked me most was when lilli was written out of the story and how that was something she didn t deserve and what do we get some blonde chick called renee with absolutely no character but these taelons stay mysterious and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end true suspence the conversations between zo or and da an are sometimes brilliant i understand that when you jump in on an episode from the 3th4th or 5th season you may not understand this show but when you watch from the beginning you just cant break loose the acting is great the special fx are marvellous the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing gotta see this guys	1
848	gene roddenberry never let her fans down her death ended sci fi legacy that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof her pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost the loss of lead kevin kilner william boone definitely hurt the series as she was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the taelons an extra terrestrial race who dub themselves  the companions  after 3 years they have given earth new technologies helpful information about the universe and more many question their intentions here on earth the main liaison on earth between the races is da an leni parker and she is to many the most trustworthy taelon questions arise just why are they here what are their goals is da an aware of any suspected plots against the humans there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors david hemblen who utilizes her millions to investigate the taelons by the end of the first season things are going well da an seems trustworthy boone assists doors in her investigation while working with da an and the taelons as a liaison in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom her wife majel barrett roddenberry was co producer still the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch	1
849	earth final conflict began like a new world a new vision from the creator of star trek something fresh and unique full of great elements a very good cast with an extremely credible kevin kilner as william boone an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race talons after the dead of her wife in strange circumstances but soon the character of kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the talons using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction as i said before the show began great all was almost perfect including characters like da an the original da an was a big mystery because she seems to be a nice creature but at the same time she has her own evil plans manipulating some people in earth soon came zo or who wasn t bad but mark the beginning of the fall of this show because she became the first big enemy of humans the incarnation of evil killing what could be something greater in da an the first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of boone and the second shows a new lead character liam an hybrid being of human and kimera another alien race with some very interesting powers she replace kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus but as i said lines before the evilness of zo or begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same talons with time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons so when the final season began the original earth final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams all the magic was missing just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of kilner and liam for a few episodes the final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes to think the writers of some episodes didn t know anything about the first stories it was one of the worst end i have ever seen in a tv show a real shame because earth final conflict began like something unique fresh the stories the cast after watch so many show from usa something from canada from the mind of the creator of star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse i hope someday someone make a remake of this show of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth except the cast everyone were perfect in her work i still can dream in a better things	1
850	i remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre i recently found a copy on vhs & it held up to my memory of it while obviously not a big budget film the acting is quite credible & the scenery locales & costumes are very well done i only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture but when you see them they are also well done remember sfx was done in those days without benefit of computers some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephantsthe same effect was used on the elephants in quest for fire a better than average adventure film & a chance for the star rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy which she also did very well over the years	1
851	interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern india features transparent special effects elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions all this said we do have a good story and a fine cast at work and an exciting climax it s been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in india courtesy of robert lippert a master at  padding  given a choice opt for the shorter version	1
852	i can t really criticize this film it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths no one believes her including her best friend played by cesar romero whose brother was among those killed and rod cameron was the only survivor the film was shot in india and has some good scenery the acting is on a high level i don t believe rod cameron cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance the mammoths when they finally arrive are fairly effective the ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950 s science fiction film definitely worth seeing	1
853	the jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie the only sci fi part is the woolly mammoths living in the present day elephants are attacking villages in a part of india and these attacks are also killing people an expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this an american hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by woolly mammoths which are suppose to be extinct nobody believes her at first but they do when the mammoths appear at the end an earthquake finishes them off the jungle was shot on location in india and has a lot of nice scenery and some good indian music including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely the mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on the cast includes rod cameron cesar romero the lost continent and marie windsor cat women of the moon the jungle is worth seeing just for the scenery and music very enjoyable rating 3 stars out of 5	1
854	this was a surprisingly very good movie and an interesting idea however it was just a little bit disappointing in that the  twist  was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie whilst watching it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow there were superb performances there was never a dull boring moment so totally well worth watching this one it kept me interested right up until the end and for me there isn t many movies that can do that these days i highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie	1
855	this movie is a mystery it s not scary it s spooky you ll probably jump at some points and for some of it you ll be scratching your head to figure it out it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum don she needs her to search for some clues to vindicate herself from murdering her mother and once eve agrees to help her she completely opens up pandora s box and unleashes some very strange things including malachi i won t go into malachi but i thought the way that played out was complete genius i know movie buffs won t regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn t have anyone very famous in it angelina jolie s brother was excellent but maybe she should have asked her sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition but i do think the way the malachi ending works is something to talk about i ve recommended this to my friends definitely worth the purchase or rental price	1
856	stephanie meyer is going to be so ticked now her book breaking dawn will not be first with that title sorry twilight fans kelly overton the ring two is medical student eve who is assigned to interview psychotic don james haven   angelina jolie s brother i suspected the twist and when she found out they both grew up in the same town i was sure of it she kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that i felt there was a shared delusion going on at times she even acted like she had ptsd i really thought she was losing it well she wasn t losing it and when the end came i was floored my whole suspicion turned out to be wrong the twist was even more amazing than i believed overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something stephanie meyer would come up with a must see	1
857	i caught this movie on local tv at about 430 am i didn t have expectations for it but after the opening credits i knew i was into something good there are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factor the whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character your sub conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion the technical aspects are very good really good in fact kelly overtone is extremely sexy and she s candy for the eye although she s most of the time in her white clothes the fear factor is almost inexistent but there s plenty of mystery and tension to dig from i would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers	1
858	when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly overton a young and op and coming star actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away she is amazing on screen and i m really looking forward to see what the future brings her the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before but a good experience  i would recommend this movie if only to see kelly overton this stage actor takes the screen by storm i give this movie a vote of 7 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie and on a last note sorry about my bad english if this is gibberish for you p plz ignore me	1
859	i saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed italthough there were several clues which i could realize after second time watching i was not able to awake the dow dawn case maybe this was my carelessnessthe subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalization let me go out the key sentence of the filmlet me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be freea discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brainanybody who have seen the  machinist  would realize the similarities with breaking dawna man that could not escape from her conscience again a psychological and an abstract conceptmeets it in an human bodyand she will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escapealso i want to mention about the performances of  breking dawn s stuffsin spite of having not many experiences from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie	1
860	i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date this year it is one of my favorites the story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and i knew what would happen far too early usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me like the others but even knowing the outcome i still enjoyed it right up to the end looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from kelly overton eve i m afraid i was not her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me in contrast to the amazing performance or characterization by james haven don wake  i hope we see more of her what a great little film highly recommended to all	1
861	saw the film at the hollywood film festival in oct  04  mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for her first film and it paid off big in her casting of kelly overton i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and surprise i m right more hollywood actors should follow her lead give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this for all the great things i can say about the film and the director and there are many i just can t stop talking to people about kelly overton s masterful performance we ll be seeing a lot more of her work no doubt  congratulations to mark and kelly on a daring film get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film asap	1
862	wow stella shorts are great lots of patrons from the state and stella the tv show i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents stella i also never knew short comedies could be any good my favorite ones were pizza racking leaves the woods and david arranges to a meeting with her long lost cousin greg i think over all that david was the funniest one its funny when she doesn t make sense i like the music in the shorts thats something i pay attention to a lot they always had good taste in music i wish they still made shorts either that or bring back there sitcom i hope they continue making good and funny comedy	1
863	when i first saw stella on comedy central i thought god this is horrible but i loved wet hot american summer so i knew something didn t make sense there was nothing left for me to do but search out for the stella shorts which i had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there when i found them not only were my dildo expectations met but i found probably the greatest comedy scenes i ve seen in years the set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs not only did i laugh my ass off the first time i watched them but continued to laugh harder when i watched them over and over again it s really a shame comedy central had the restrictions of cable television for the stella series it would have faired much better on hbo or showtime their brand of humor can t be restricted by censors or popular culture given even if it was on hbo i m sure the masses would have voted it canceled in a season or less but still it would have been fantastic needless to say i m now in love with stella and all it s individual members any stella fan should check out david wain s site with all her short films they are equally as enjoyable as stella itself so my hat goes off to michael showalter michael ian black and david wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with stella i hope to see much more of the troupe in the future	1
864	hilarious and low budget comedy at it s best this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines filled with ethnic slurs and awful language sex toys included there should be more comedy like this around today this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts if you enjoyed the state and or wet hot american summer get ready for some more glory if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this	1
865	if you were ever a fan of mtvs the state then these three guys will be familiar to you but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy born out of their stand up comedy trio  stella  michael ian black michael showalter and david wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows and now after being available only to download from two websites they appear in pristine glory on one dvd think comedy sketch show sans censorship and you d be halfway there no stone of decency is left unturned but for those who like their comedy rude self indulgent and bordering on puerile and i mean that in the most flattering way this is the dvd for you i think it s worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone you can t help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse fantastic it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie bowen and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly and you should follow their fine example throw preconceptions to the wind and prepare to laugh yourself sick	1
866	i honestly don t know what words imdb will allow me to use in this review as a result i m having a hard time describing these shorts let s just say there s a good amount of gay sex some necrophilia some incest a fair amount of masturbation and several artificial members and i loved every minute of it not that it s all crude humor it isn t they stray away from fart gags for the most part with the exception of one sketch entitled pizza in which they use one very well they being 3 11ths of the short lived sketch comedy group that aired on mtv called the state namely david wain michael showalter and michael ian black the trio go on adventures usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people people that are often actually more normal than they are the supporting cast is fantastic as well paul rudd julie bowen bradley cooper zach galifianakis and sam rockwell all make appearances in various sketches they re also joined by other the state alums like joe lo truglio and todd holoubek the musical selections are also very well placed i ve enjoyed these sketches over and over again but they aren t for everybody as they re pretty vulgar most of the time if you like clever humor that isn t afraid to push the limits of good taste then i highly recommend this if you liked wet hot american summer directed and written by wain and showalter or the state then you should really enjoy this i think it can currently only be ordered online check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first and then find out how to buy the dvd	1
867	mississippi mermaid is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the wrong person truffaut s directing is her usual outstanding work although this is far from her best deneuve is very very beautiful despite the character she portrays	1
868	this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters a title like this makes a film flop even the french title is not much better too bad   truffaut & deneuve must have been enough to sell it this is a long film but largely worth it clearly influenced by hitchcock we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride her rich husband a theft an identity switch and obsessive love the plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected trip the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people unfortunately this is what bogs the film down and makes it ultimately dissatisfying we do like films to have a real sense of finality and that is missing here it was the case in many of her films that deneuve became a canvas for directors to play their fantasies out on and this time it doesn t work as well messy here is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have deneuve take her top off a few times deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat  basically the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap but truffaut didn t snap did she so   it wanders a bit but remains interesting	1
869	a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel waltz into darkness of the writer cornell woolrich it is a drama rather than a film noir which tries to send a message that love changes your own life ie your love to any person and the love you received from her her a wealthy man really changed her life for love while her partner finally understood that she was the only one that loved her belmondo played well as usual while a somewhat still young michel bouquet played her eternal role of a detective or police agent frankly bouquet was not so impressive in this film but less than that was the performance of catherine deneuve she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover wife of louis mah√© belmondo for those who like to visit the world the film offers the occasion to see part of the ascension island and also lyon city in france	1
870	this agreeable french movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an african island nearly to madagascar named louisjean paul belmondo she s a single man looking wife then she advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named juliacatherine deneuve when she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected she marries to julia but she suddenly disappearsa french eye privatemichael bouquet is hired by julia s sister and soon she s on the trail of her previous spouse later louis encounters her in a dancing hall under another name in spite of the romantic delusion and everything louis goes on enamored with her enigmatic wife this film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayaldeception killing theft and hitchcockian suspense good performances by jean paul belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful catherine deneuve as suspect heroine the film gets several references to the american cinema but truffaut400 blows was a fervent moviegoer such as  johnny guitar colorado jim bogart and hitchcockthe usa version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering loosely based on the novel titled waltz into darkness  by cornell woolrich rear window and screenwriter of alfred hitchcock hour who also was adapted in  truffaut s the bride wore black colorful cinematography by denys clervalstolen kisses and atmospheric musical score by antoine duhamel truffaut s usual musicianthis is one of the best of her suspense movies along with ¬®farenheit 451 and shoot the piano player¬® remade by an inferior version by michael christofer2001 with antonio banderas angelina jolie and jack thompson full of erotic and lust scenes	1
871	the film is a joy to watch not just for the plot which is gripping but also for the superb performances of the actors deneuve and belmondo though considered a  flop  on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why deneuve s acting style suited the film brilliantly she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is i will not spoil it with saying what though it is divulged fairly early on belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist i would recommend this film to all truffaut or deneuve fans it is a brilliant hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does the film is approx 2 hrs so you feel that you have not been sold short deneuve steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film truffaut was very much smitten with her a definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan 10 10	1
872	contains spoilers people who put a lonely heart s ad in the newspaper are often idealists they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect the exchange of letters is full of hopelouis mahe jean paul belmondo owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la reunion east of madagascar is so affected by the letters of julie roussell that she proposes to her but not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the mississippi but   catherine deneuve and we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place she shows no interest in julie s wardrobe she does not even get her trunk open and neglects her canary until it dies but the most basic tricks of seduction an open zipper are sufficient to transform louis into a pliable little dog first a joint bank account and then when julie s sister draws attention to herself the flight with 27850 millions of louis  28 millions   she would have needed her signature for the entire sum louis and julie s sister engage a private detective michel bouquet louis contrives to trace marion deneuve s real name in antibes where she works as taxi girl   her gangster lover left her penniless or rather centimeless louis finds herself unable to kill her she tells her story orphan precocious lesbian experiences many sugardaddies jail   and soon she leads her by the nose again the detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound louis and marion bury her body in the cellar they flee to paris where louis discovers that marion has a costly taste she worships money like a deity she sells her firm at a fraction of its value but when the corpse of the detective is discovered a flood they have to flee again   without the money life in a mountain lodge together with a whining loser   marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage a high point in the careers of everybody involved belmondo s self deceit makes her nearly endearing deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by yves st laurent and her performance is delightful at first she fakes the fragile wifey   too timid to ask her husband for money that s why the joint bank account is needed   but after being exposed she sounds like katharine hepburn in the jail scene of bringing up baby the scenery is spectacular   the tropics the riviera paris truffaut directs with self evident aplomb the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions after this film truffaut was able to look her idol alfred hichcock full in the face	1
873	in reunion island in the indian ocean the owner of a cigarette factory louis mah√© jean paul belmondo is engaged through correspondence with julie roussel and she does not know her when julie arrives in the island to get married with louis she waits for her in the docks but louis does not recognize julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to louis they get married and louis shares her bank accounts with her when julie s sister writes a letter to louis asking her sister to write to her louis discovers that the woman is not julie that is missing further she finds that the woman has cleared her bank accounts and left the island louis and julie s sister hire an efficient private detective comolli michel bouquet and louis travels to france seeking the woman but she has a nervous breakdown in nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic she recovers and finds that the woman actually marion vergano catherine deneuve works in the phoenix club priv√© in antibes and lives in the low budget monorail hotel louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club she tells that she was happy with her but her former dangerous lover richard had blackmailed her louis is still in love with marion and escapes with her to the countryside but comolli is chasing marion in france accused of murdering julie la sir√®ne du mississipi is a film noir by the great director writer fran√ßois truffaut with an unconventional love story of passion murder and love that hurts the femme fatale catherine deneuve is astonishing probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room jean paul belmondo is very athletic and the sequence when she escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive catherine deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of louis my vote is eight title brazil a sereia do mississipi the mississippi mermaid	1
874	i ve slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine deneuve and francois truffaut both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time   fortunately mississipi mermaid is not one of them next to the soft skin coincidentally staring deneuve s sister the late francoise dorleac this would have to be my favourite truffaut film as well as directing truffaut also wrote the screenplay something that always strikes me about truffaut is her almost childlike innocence when presenting a story    one could almost call it naivety there s a scene towards the end of the film where belmondo returns to the apartment in lyon with the remains of the loot she rings the doorbell and deneuve answers wearing a negligee in the time it takes belmondo to reach their room from the street deneuve changes into her dress puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep it s a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child   but that s truffaut for you watching catherine deneuve in her films of the late 60 s is indeed a sensory pleasure she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film   indeed a sinful pleasure i disagree with previous posters i see nothing  hitchcockian  about the film at all as for the  look  of it   i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60 s it certainly gives films of this period a unique look highly recommended for both deneuve and truffaut fans	1
875	this is one of the best films i ve seen in the last yearsbelmonndo and deneuve shine in their respective roles she as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic tricksterwords won t do this masterpiece justicesuffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the painhumiliation and capacity for self delusion that go with it although it s dressed as a film noir forget that feeble remake with jolie and banderas see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty	1
876	i love this movie it is the first film master p have ever done it is based on the story of her life it is low budget but it is very good it shows how master p grew up in projects in new orleans not only did master p start in this movie she also was the writer and director with moon jones the dvd also has the no limit ice cream party on it this movie shows how master p goes from bad too good and how she had to deal with the things around her it also has many of the no limit records roster in this film you should buy or rent this film it is a great movie to watch is you like rap or is a master p fan i will not spoil this movie for you go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it you will like it	1
877	this movie was marketed extremely well when it was released in  97 during the middle of master p s fame and success anything and everything with her name on it was selling off the shelves that s why it s no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250000 copies and still goin  if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out it has a few old school phatty videos and don t get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party so what i got to say to all the people who don t like master p or no limit records don t watch it because it isn t for you and don t bother voting on it because you re only going to deter tru no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes	1

880	jewel thief is *the* crime thriller of bollywood and why should it not be it is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in indian cinema vijay anand  johny mera naam  and  teesri manzil i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons in order of importance 1 vijay anand s direction 2 r d burman s music 3 dev anand 4 vyjayanthimala 5 ashok kumar 6 majrooh sultanpuri s lyrics even if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes helen tanuja and the mysterious vyajanthimala and some cameos but our sauv√© vinay dev anand is anything but bond she is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes her almost always as confused as we are she even flirts with anju tanuja trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that she can get employed in her father s shop dev anand might be in a double role   well i don t want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you that is what most of the mystery is about dev anand works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when she is supposed to be at work   though is not or at least has a perfect alibi we wonder who did it is it dev anand as  vijay  the person she claims to be or is it  amar  someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is her look alike comes  shalu  vyjayanthimala who even claims that she is her fianc√© in a tense situation dev anand has to prove that she is vinay and not amar while everyone wonders if dev anand is vinay or amar she is asked to remove her socks amar we are told has 6 digits on one of her foot while we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold dev anand even finds time to joke  the real life brothers director vijay anand and actor dev anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller  there are moments of hitchcock s north by northwest but the movies are very different except for the confusion about who is who a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn t a lot of similarity dev anand could very well be amar in addition to being vijay people have seen her they identify her where ever she goes there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud finally vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being amar to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake she gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of cinema when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like but i d recommend this movie anyway even as a kid i enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer  yeh dil     a definite loafers song in kishor kumar s voice i could hear  rulake gaya   whole day long ditto for  aasmaan ke neeche  which is set  under the skies  of gangtok at least the story line suggests that  raat akeli hai  among the sexiest song to come out of hindi cinema featuring tanuja as the seductress  meri taraf dekho    helen s cabaret and we  look at her   hothon pe     now could there be any better thriller of a song than this as the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words  hidden in shalu s lips  add to it	1
881	unlike bond and other detective movies alfred hitchcock s hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with her acumen and courage and luck would get out of it jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is vijay anand s tribute to the master of suspense the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes vijay anand as a great director herself it is the story of a common man vinay who one day realizes that she has a double called amar who in fact is a jewel thief suddenly vinay finds herself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save herself goes on a wild goose chase to find this amar who remains one step ahead of her the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme just like hitchcock s movies jewel thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of sikkim everyone and i mean everyone dev anand vijay anand ashok kumar vajyanti mala tanuja sd burman kishore kumar majrooh sultanpuri etc etc are in their top forms this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india	1
882	jewel thief is a rare breed of film   completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation a young man vinay superbly played by a newly face lifted dev anand at age 40+ is estranged from her police officer dad and finds a job in a jeweler s store soon random people come up to her and call her amar using just a few pithy moments the presence of a doppelganger is established then a woman shalini vyjayantimala comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger she is accompanied by her loving brother ashok kumar who is so convinced that vinay is actually amar she makes her take her shoe off and prove that she is not aamr the 6 toed one the jeweler s super cute daughter anju tanuja is completely enamored with vinay amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and she is stealing at will slowly we learn from vinay s encounter with a super hot night club singer helen that the thief is amar the doppelganger many many good looking women anju mahendru faryal are after the hero the police force including vinay s dad are completely befuddled vinay is slowly falling for shalini shalu and her brother seems to bless the union the action moves to sikkim as that is where amar s next heist is to occur the rest is for you to watch   the duplicate the girls the men who hang on to vinay s every word thinking she is their boss amar the loving brother sister duo   nothing seems quite right and it takes the deft story telling and direction by vijay anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in sikkim i was not a big vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here although at her chubbiest she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing tanuja is cute as a button and i loved her in this film i so badly wanted her to get the man dev was well dev if she were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect one shoulder always lower than the other i would wonder who they had found to imitate her yet her style charm and charisma were unfailing in the song yeh dil na hota bechara only dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached ashok kumar was simply awesome   dada moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books sd burman spun magic with numbers like baithe hain kya uske paas helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top aasman ke neeche rula ke gaya sapna mera and my personal favorite seductive number raat akeli hai bujh gaye diye if you are craving a great story with more twists than a pretzel wanting to be kept guessing yet amused and entertained   then go buy or rent jewel thief better to buy it then you can go back and see it again with your buddies this one is a keeper	1
883	nice movie at the begining i thought it s a medieve detective kind hi fi movie but the ending totally surprised me i guess the whole movie covers too many subjects each of them can be the main subjecteg avenge friendship and dream but it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them i think it d be a great movie if it s built around the ending from the very begining 	1
884	although i saw this movie in korea in korean and therefore did not understand the language images sure say more than enough from what i can make of it this is the story two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king s guard one of them finds herself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men the other has to hunt her down this movie is visually great the swordfighting is great and the movie has a gripping end i just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers and be released on dvd of course	1
885	i must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out it wasn t as epic as musa the warriors and didn t develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas simple story a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days her counterpart was formerly the best friend she had and now she is out to stop her the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right and me personallyi loved the end i could watch it over and over again maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story people can be killed but not the ideas they stand for	1
886	after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films i thought it looked very entertaining before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings despite the hype i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable  the story was great just pay attention and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing i haven t seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond as reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more this film is what it is its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action while sword in the moon isn t perfect what movie is it still is wonderful and moving just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting	1
887	i saw the movie on its north american premiere july 14 2004 at the fantasia festival i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic ensemble cast movie along the lines of musa the warrior instead the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters still the movie was solid thoughtful and visually intriguing there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties intrigue and blood versus the lighter more flamboyant martial arts sequences it almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn t make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one s master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones how does one decide these questions are raised in this movie and ironically there is the suggestion that the answer given may in fact be the wrong one	1
888	well sword in the moon finally got a dvd release in korea and despite the mostly negative responses i ve heard to it and the suspiciously tardy dvd release i couldn t help but pick it up   any wu xia film is better than most non wu xia films in my eyes d perhaps low expectations were an advantage because i was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable an assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the government s top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit this doesn t take particularly long but the answer is not one she wanted to hear through prolonged flashbacks we learn why and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution the film is typically melodramatic for a korean film and resolutely serious in tone   no hk style comedy moments to be found here the story can be a little difficult to follow at first but all makes sense eventually the film goes a bit wobbly at the end but no worse than a chang cheh film might do and for the most part i found it enjoyable the production values are high with some good cinematography to capture it the fight scenes aren t up to the calibre of the better hk wu xia films but perhaps they re not meant to be   the fights are more realistic in that they re less like choreographed dance routines but there s some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode the film doesn t have the best cast unfortunately with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other there s a young lady in the film that i don t think i ve seen before but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast   not just because you see her nekkid or perhaps it is p the film lacks the charm and grace of the better hk wu xia films and perhaps the beauty too but i only wish hk would make them half this good anymore   twins effect 2 does not give me hope that *that s* about to happen any time soon though tsui hark surely still has it in her if she can get the funding and cast sword in the moon is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means but it s a whole heap better than romantic warriors or legend of the evil lake   perhaps better than bichunmoo too though i did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing obviously it s nowhere near the wonderful musa but it s a different affair altogether really sitm will probably get a second viewing within three years which is perhaps the best indicator of how much i liked it  7 10	1
889	spawned by the same monty berman   dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall & hopkirk deceased   the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market   department s remains a classic example of the action adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s like those two shows its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality dept s also has a black superior but it s mostly facade the launch episode six days is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra panties and one yes one stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation still it s an interesting time capsule even if the appalling fashion sense of peter wyngarde s character which amazingly degenerated even further in the spin off series jason king should definitely have remained buried	1
890	with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde s jason king most people remember her as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character she s far more nuanced than that jason king is lazy she often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end she is egotistical her appreciation of people is based on whether they ve read her novels or not a lot of her detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and she sulks whenever annabelle is rightand she often is she s clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives butjason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played her purely as a dashing hero it wouldn t have worked but she shows king often as a paper tiger led by her libido love of finery and prone to grandstanding and it gets in the way of her detective work at times but she has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing her as whiter than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king	1
891	created by dennis spooner  department s  was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol based in geneva created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle if a plane landed at heathrow with no one aboard if a man was found wandering around london in a space suit if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters you called on  department s  to sort things out peter wyngarde played  jason king  a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases king caught the public s fancy and was later awarded a spin off show she was ably assisted by american  stuart sullivan   joel fabiani  and the delectable  annabelle hurst   rosemary nicols  unusually for a  60 s show the department was headed by a black man    sir curtis seretse   dennis alaba peters  if the show looked and felt a lot like  the avengers  it was hardly surprising it shared many of the same writers and directors the colourful titles were designed by chambers & partners and are worth tuning in for alone as was the case with so many itc series the music was composed by edwin astley her theme for  department s  has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time predictably the show looks a little sexist and dated now but don t let that dissuade you from tuning in imagine a hybrid of  jonathan creek  and the  austin powers  movies and you ve got  department s  trivia note the episode  a small war of nerves  features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role	1
892	like night stalker and then x files the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out unlike these the heroes weren t left holding an empty bag at the end they had usually tangible results it was also made clear that the  good guys  were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things imagination wit acting which didn t always take itself too seriously  i miss it one reason being i m hard pressed to think of too many shows   banacek aside   which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense too i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasn t just for eye candy she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it a rarity in those days sullivan if she wasn t in the department she d be working for the kgb or cia she s that sort of coldly efficient ruthless type she knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done king it s clearly a game to her one she excels at and which she parleys into ideas for the detective spy novels she writes as her ostensible  real  job she s probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too i do agree that the eventual spin off series featuring only her character lacked the interest of the original however	1
893	the incomparable laura gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french emmanuelle 2 this amazing woman did not go unnoticed and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series where she is the centerpiece a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer in this first installment mae jordan emanuelle is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals much like sylvia kristels character emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality this first film is basically about how she becomes the emanuelle that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with filled with gorgeous cinematography beautiful people and an intoxicating 70 s score from the legendary nico fidenco this one is sure to please those who enjoy the more story driven style of the original french emmanuelle should definitely like this as well the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that she has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of her sexy fun and totally entertaining throughout a soap opera to be sure but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd there has never been a legitimate dvd for this which is very strange the bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release	1
894	you know you re watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you i m okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too every time someone says anything it sounds like there s a narrator either way this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot don t get me wrong there s a fair dose of exploitation in this one but there s always room for more laura gemser stars and that s good because she s hot it s a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure but she still rules over her white counterpart you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of often every reason is good every person is good every location is good one scene even involves an entire hockey team whatever they are doing in africa sometimes the plot gets in the way and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people but there s enough laura gemser for all	1
895	laura gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to africa for a photo shoot there she is met by a couple and other swinging couples they all stay at this huge very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool one night they have a pool party complete with real live native dancers it s very un politically correct and very kitschy later emanuelle finally has her photo shoot which turns out to be in one of those drive through stay in your car safaris albeit the photography is gorgeous throughout the film emanuelle is going after every man she meets the photography is very well done in this film there are scenes with cascading waterfalls galloping giraffes and ancient ruins the film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by nico fidenco alone	1
896	the first of the italian rip offs of the french soft porn blockbuster though it might be interesting to note that the boot shaped country actually got their first with cesare canevari s 1968 io emmanuelle starring erika blanc is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late questionably great joe d amato it is much closer in spirit to the now very dated just jaeckin film from 1973 taking a pokerfaced look at male female relationships questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy all in luxurious exotic surroundings unlike d amato director albert thomas aka adalberto albertini who also made the hard to find yellow emanuelle actually a sexed up version of madame butterfly  does not present us with predatory drug lords snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience photo journalist mae jordan aka  emanuelle  lovely java born laura gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a thai masseuse in emmanuelle 2 and an  unspoilt native  in just jaeckin s portion of the rarely seen collections privees flies down to nairobi where she s to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted british writer anne played by the very teutonic karin schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to anne shares an  open relationship  remember when this was made with her italian husband gianni angelo infanti meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse contrary to her subsequent reputation emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts smoldering seductively at gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay off okay so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train i kid you not production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive especially the superb cinematography and nico fidenco s musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre a hilarious eurotrash pop ditty try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening s worth of fun with the family  that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow  n  sexy to hip gyrating disco this is entirely laura gemser s show though billed simply as  emanuelle  as was another actress on the same director s elusive emanuelle nera 2 she lights up the screen from start to finish not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios as she would be once d amato took over she seems much more relaxed than in later films even smiling from time to time a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady s work surely knows a flawless eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty she hails from dutch india now indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel emmanuelle arsan she projects a slightly passive even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the  depravity  her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in unlike the french film cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum almost thrown in as an afterthought near film s end when emanuelle tells gianni that she hasn t lost her as she never possessed her to begin with i swear you could hear audiences of the just jaeckin version groan whenever alain cuny s supremely irritating mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine sylvia kristel now living in the belgian capital of brussels by the way to disrobe the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end gemser s later husband gabriele tinti now deceased she has remarried appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk  scottish  huh  writer who forces herself briefly on emanuelle amid the african ruins at some point but no real sex scene though	1
897	the main reason to check this one out is to watch laura gemser in all her glory that s reason enough for me she heads to africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films huge mansion near the jungle hunters staying around for parties when they aren t out hunting zebras and said parties becoming drunken orgies all the high society types in the emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes and emanuelle beds most of them joe d amato did not direct this one she just ripped it off and used the same casts and did anyone notice the  subliminal  sexual images at the gas station and why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes  coherence hardly any but goddess gemser is beautiful	1
898	i have so much hope for the sequel to gen x luckily my hopes have came true you got a whole bunch of action comedysilly comedy and surprises i think the newcomer edison is really a hit in the movie but i really find sam s  alien  stupidly annoying with english although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong the action set up is much stronger than the 1st this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60% of the movie is in english from the cantonese this movie will not disappoint you i recommended this for young  uns that care about pure action packed fun 	1
899	i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funnyyou know the kind that you ll crack up on the ground and you ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeksdespite the bad acting bad cgi and bad storyabout cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison s attention and gave her the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at her so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember rememberto my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was therejust before they fought and kurt was talking about her strange dream and how she was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don t remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can t stop laughing i wish i had that movie 	1
900	gen y copssince i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn t return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match who has a steady girl in oli note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen she makes a great replacement for nicholas tse asedison i also enjoyed paul rudd s performance of agent curtishe seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth fbi agent you d love to hatebut soon you d like her character the fight scenes are a lot better in this oneeven though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd if you liked gen x copsyou ll love gen y cops	1
901	this film is great all the hi tech machinery and technology is mind boggling it is packed with action humour and not to mention guys you will want to see it again and again very very funny also it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable you wouldn t want to miss out on it	1
902	i am having a holiday in hong kong now and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema what can i say it was sooo cool everything you could wish for was in it basically just see it if ya can i m gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the hl actors like edison what s up my man but it did add even more humour to iy hhehe see it especially if ya like any of the following geners hkfilm action comedy sci fi seeitman edison did a good song for it too so download it edison tse   heroes	1
903	this is a well done action movie there are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing for this genre and rs1 is awesome i don t know why people feel compelled to trash rs1 i thought her effects were executed very nicely and her design looked great the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie having said that i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched at least rs1 had the right idea by killing her now for all of you who thought sam lee alien was a bad actorhe wasn t meant to be taken seriously i have just had the pleasure of watching gen x cops prequel and sam lee played the same character the same way now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners do not judge this is a thinking man s movie it isn t supposed to require thought just meant to be enjoyed that s all i hope they make another soon	1
904	genius or utter madness that depends on your interpretation of this film i responded to it on the level of a self aware cop movie parody and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i don t see anyone taking it seriously  d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from her core background in the comedy genre some kind of insane attempt to reinvent her as a hard boiled action star i think not  with the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget fx and zany over the top action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old tv show sledge hammer for me hilarious   of course i may have totally interpreted the film wrong if it was in fact an attempt at a  straight  action movie then it was certainly an amusing failure watch with lots of alcohol and some mates  	1
905	this movie is certainly worth a watch it s full of action it s also humorous you ll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie this movie also includes lots of hi tech things hence the name gen y i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen x	1
906	this is a laurel & hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise the comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple stan laurel not wearing any pants laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt for some reason she gets the center of attention because of this and her uncle played by oliver hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on philip its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments it at the same time is also far from the best of the many laurel & hardy comedy shorts that are still around the movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest although it definitely is most fine executed all for most part great good clean fun just nothing too remarkable or memorable all 7 10	1
907	this is one of l&h s shorts most frequently cited as the first real l&h teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features j piedmont mumblethunder ollie is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet her nephew philip whom she s never seen at first ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to herself by the way she s behaving during her medical exam but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow she s supposed to be greeting she has been told that philip is a good boy but she has one weakness  women mumblethunder and philip set off to go home but their journey there is continually interrupted by philip breaking into a little dance every time she sees a woman then chasing after the woman huge crowds gather each time this happens not so much because she s chasing skirts but because philip herself is also wearing a skirt a kilt finally mumblethunder manages to drag philip into a tailor s shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants but philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts there are lots of laughs all around it s also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren t exactly the characters we know and love ollie is pretty much her usual character but it s such a joy to see stan acting so differently from her usual man child character it shows she wasn t a one trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when she got the chance with a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches	1
908	stan laurel regarded putting pants on philip as the first ¬ëtrue  l&h film the second hundred years was the first  official  l&h film but this was the one where stan completely resigned herself not only to performing she had signed on with the hal roach studios as a director and  gag man  before certain situations   among them oliver hardy s accident with a leg of lamb leading to stan having to replace her and the extra money that performing would provide for herself and her new wife lois   brought about her historic return to performing as well as writing directing editing and involvement in other areas of production but also realised the fact that she was part of a team that worked well together this therefore is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy it is also a surprisingly funny little silent film rather different from what laurel & hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today the characters of  stan & ollie do not appear   scottish stan laurel plays the nephew of oliver hardy a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls there are some very funny moments in this well made charming little movie and the performances of these two kings of comedy are spot on   watch stan s little  scissor kick  and smile that says well waddaya know when she sees girls or the hair ruffling scene at the airport for instance hilarious watch this film if you can with backing music from the beau hunks orchestra available on the vvl video releases which enhances the 1920s feel and is very very pleasant to listen to it s a brilliant and underrated little film which is why i said it was  surprisingly  funny	1
909	transcendental sophisticated incisive emotive powerful i could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence and still i would feel they were insufficient all i can really say is that i am infatuated with this film applause to krzysztof kieslowski zbigniew preisner ir√®ne jacob and jean louis trintignant may rouge live forever	1
910	what some hollywood movies try and practically never succeed creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons without becoming unrealistic manages this beautiful movie perfectly well resembling in that way a little to the wonderful  la double vie de veronique  of the same director and with the same beautiful actress this is a real movie that changes perspective of life a little bit   intelligent and beautiful story masterfully directed excellent main actors masterful cinematography i ve just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time and i still think it s one of the best i ve ever seen and if you should be unhappy with the ending of  white     red  puts an happy end to the whole trilogy	1
911	a wonder my favorite film the most important film about relationships ever made brilliant writing magnificent directing image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days weeks years later wow a truly great work of art	1
912	this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but it s not poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched not to mention the amazing ir√®ne jacob a great actress in france   one of the best actually when the movie ends you can only feel sorry after all when something is truly great we want more well for another great movie by k kieslowsky with ir√®ne jacob we can always watch la double vie de veronique	1

914	irene jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of krzysztof kieslowski s trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together i am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories let alone all three everything seems to fit together so precisely all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts trois couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements simply brilliant	1
915	most of kieslowski s films seem like puzzles to me meant to expand mind and soul the characters are not very believable are idealized are schematic nevertheless the way kieslowski presents their winding ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me want to believe in god that at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someone trois couleurs and especially rouge comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of her films the only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to her other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable there is still plenty of joy to be had here it is like a familiar brand of wine   you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging   either the wine or yourself	1
916	rouge is part of a trilogy but very much stands on its own it isn t a sequel of any sort the very end which i won t divulge ties the three films together but not seeing the other two doesn t make it too confusing  this film amazes me because it is so spare so subtle and simple but is as effective emotionally and intellectually as any big budget spectacle or all star melodrama kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny both themes are loosely woven together in the story the film is very much a puzzle but the message is pretty straightforward everything happens for a reason love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it the title red refers to the french flag where red represents fraternity or brotherhood the color dominates the visuals of the movie i tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life it s great when a film allows the freedom to do that 	1
917	there s a spartan unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us how we re meant to be feeling in  blue  everything was overtly sad sure powerful as hell but still in  white  it was delightful whimsy but there are no such emotional clues or cues for that matter in this one it s as if she finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle dazzle embelishment i think that s what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most transcendent and redemptive never has remorseless unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful	1
918	valentine dogkiller dussaut and joe the judge kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of geneva thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers polish fugitives peeping toms philandering girlfriends renegade dogs and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables don t be fooled by the deceptive miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house flick this movie is 100% action	1
919	i use imdb very much mainly reading comments of other people about movies i¬¥ve or not seen i¬¥ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and the way i look a movie i think i have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94 when i saw it in the theatre for the first time i feel kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time and i think this is her best one it was her last one i was very sad the day i knew she has died because sure we lost the chance to get something more from her red is just the best kieslowski + incredibile performance by trintignant & jacob + cinematography by sobocinski if you haven¬¥t seen it look for it if you have just come back to it red just a masterpiece please forgive my poor english reader	1
920	the greatest movie ever how s that for a contention however if we look at it through purely cinematic terms it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece it is not enough to merely say this   three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough if you accept that star wars is not actually very good if you accept that ozu and mizoguchi both have to take a step back   then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time as a discussion into human morality three colours red works on an intensely metaphysical level with a depth that none can match blue went almost as far into the human psyche but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat white forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality   this in retrospect was better still but still not quite there red however is the real thing what she expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human in fact what she expresses is _how_ it is to feel human it forces us to examine up to the minutest detail the very nature of our souls of our ethical selves in red one may find meaning on one of its several levels on the first level red achieves a high level of verisimilitude   we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story however the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie it is as if kieslowski is saying ceci n est pas la r√©alit√© in effect in pursuing a humanistic goal kieslowski can also challenge reality it is a trick that kieslowski has been attempting since le double vie de v√©ronique but not until this her final film did she finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate philosophy and circumstance the actors and actresses too appear to be at the mercy of a greater power valentine ir√®ne jacob is aptly name for she seems to represent an almost pure love meanwhile the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean louis tritignant s judge kern a cantankerous man who by the end becomes an almost all knowing observer of events   a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together   a power to make people happy a power which she could only achieve through valentine we have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures in fact films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature it won t happen of course but at least we have the power to view this film knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can t define but all possess a synopsis of this film read a film about a woman who runs over a dog well it is isn t it  simon huxtable 	1
921	this is a classic continuation to bleu the likewise excellent film with juliet binouche as a main star moreover she is a cameo appearance here in rouge just for a second at the very end but this film truly red and very sweet although very sad is a real winner the main heroine played by ever great irene jakob is a successful photo   fashion model she leads a full active life only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend mike who is in england by some lucky chance she gets friendly with the old judge who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of her neighbors the story starts to weave even further and we see her in court being almost universally condemned for her pastime she is the only one who feels sympathy for her for her cute doggy rita and her pups and for all the people who surround them we also witness the break up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and her lady and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal but the film is not about this even it is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people far and near when she sails to england on a ferry with that lawyer as a chance fellow passenger as well as that earlier mentioned binoche who starred in bleu the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of the judge when she watches the news trying to guess if she survived she did and still we feel very heavy at heart mr kislowski managed to draw a grand subtle story about the solitude misunderstanding secrets and pain deep dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely brilliant film	1
922	in my analysis of trois couleurs blanc i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of trois couleurs bleu i think it s the same with this film this time it s not because of a tragic comedy element but much more because of the main character valentine although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with lightness and optimism it seems to me that she might be kieslowski s image for a carefree youth the opposite seems to be the judge who is very pessimistic a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness in my view valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one finally i would like to stress ir√®ne jacob s performance she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the three colours trilogy	1
923	well every scene so perfectly presented never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching amilie amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch these movies are both based on a same plot line but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s and i am still thinking about it the story is great and the ending is a bit funny i was laughing in the end scene well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected all in all a great work of art a work of a masterman 10 10	1
924	i believe i share the same psychological outlook on the world with kieslowski she is polish i am dutch yet we share a synthetic mind the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet prime minister so that as a social and cultural  low pressure area  poland could play the role it did in wwii being critical yet christian towards the jews but often not less critical toward oneself there are innocence and guilt in kieslowski s world view as the symbols in catholicism the white versus the black madonna in rouge the black madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when she was a young man flashbacks are magically realistically intertwined with the present although totally coincidental such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge s red jeep passing by the now young woman s car after she accidentally hit her dog with it that we leaped through time in those same camera moves is what we grasp later her love was unanswered so that her life wasn t as she had planned it she lost her ability to love other people and animals being a judge she feels she is actually spying on other peoples  lives and when she retires she simply continues to do so spying on her neighbors this time the innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman literally accidentally getting into her life reinstalls her better judgment and it is because of her that she spontaneously confesses her spying behavior to her neighbors and the police accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through her windows in the process history repeats itself between this man and the woman she loves although this time she is old and the woman not the same kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is her alter ego and it is said she was infatuated by ir√®ne jacob both women play the same essential role in her psychology of the one  who possesses her heart and soul and therefore can make her or break her even as an old man it is as if the  powers in the air  are or god is bringing them together coincidences are *too* coincidental to just be chance or even good luck there has to be some mystical supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life decisions the study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this or the moment the old judge spoke her heart to the young woman the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows the gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on tv after the drowning accident on her canal crossing trip these moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it van den budenmayer	1
925	are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen s everyday s life is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed the director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions almost sympathetic towards judge jean luis  destabilizing decision of coming to terms with her own inducted self seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by her trois couleurs rouge is based on the concept of universal communication conceived as the human desire of an open window on the world the phone may be considered the main character of the story after its performance in dekalog 9 it gives in the beginning the encore to kieslowski s onlookers followed step by step in its fast run across the world the director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior once again she points out to us the unpredictability of future events venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations   some books falling to the pavement   one of them opening casually on a fatal page predetermining the destiny of a future profession as in a past similar occurrence   glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician van den budermayer   human fortunes marked by the most ill fated coincidence in this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart s eyes instead of our mind s ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge jean luis  jean louis trintignant and valentine dussaut irene jacob maybe the sweetest actress of our times together with the beautiful winona ryder in a generational conflict between the experience of a world weary old man and the self conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way kieslowski talks about dialogue tests between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness and the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by her great passion for cinema only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill good bye krzysztof we miss you so much	1
926	master kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman s life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction while i m not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90 s decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen the movie begins a little slow but finds it s rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they re not clich√©d in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn t get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis tringtignat deserved an oscar nod at least the music from zbiegnew preisner is amazing it s one of the best musical scores ever piotr sobocinsk cinematography is also outstanding she got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don t don t miss it how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my comprehension	1
927	trilogies are very interesting some go out with a bang lord of the rings some get progressively weaker the matrix some get lost in obscurity blade back to the future but some maintain the genius that seemingly ever growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior case and point three colors trilogy this chapter in the trilogy being the last one is the most philosophical and thought provoking in blue we had a more visually stunning more character driven plot in white it was more of a light hearted narrative driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything red however is focused on the what ifs and how comes it questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present this chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings her back to her owner she soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on her neighbors  phone calls through advanced spying equipment all three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines but bring a lot more to the story consider in blue the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones we are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary french society and how that reflects the character s behavior red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man s life but it is also about chance hope and fate irene jacob stars as valentine dussaut who at first finds the old man jean louis trintignant whom we never find the name of extremely self centered and disgusting though through self reflective analysis and her voyeuristic intentions she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if only she was 40 years younger irene lives across from another younger judge who highly resembles the old man this is the what if that keeps circling in the movie what if irene were born 40 years ago the old man would have been her perfect match but what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match since she so closely resembles the older one valentine doesn t know this only we do and krzysztof kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which irene is in we are constantly smacked in the face with her presence as almost a suggestion of irene s fate i mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason that reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story we are to compare the old judge to auguste jean pierre lorit the younger judge in more than one way we learn that the old man once had someone she loved but she got away in another scene we see auguste heartbroken as the love of her life gets away with another man there are constant reminders of whether or not valentine will ever meet this man even though they pass each other without noticing every single day there is also the motif of the telephone to valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life to auguste it is what leads to her heartbreak and to the old man it is the only thing she has left these three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology it is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are all three colors films stand for a certain principle most common in france blue stands for liberty the personal being white stands for equality being accepted by more than one and red is fraternity to socialize to learn and although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the fraternity principle kieslowski makes sure she brings in the other two as well in order to connect all three stories for example we see the old man trying to reach out to valentine and enlighten her with her spy equipment which is a reflection of the equality principle we also see near the end that valentine is doing some soul searching and that she s more concerned about herself than others not picking up the phone when michel calls a clear example of liberty and with all three principles established kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well in the final and most heartfelt scene red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger it is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone and whether or not one person can change your life the final chapter in the most awe inspiring trilogy ever made this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling it is not only about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time and although the movie is more subtle than both blue and white it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion it s hard to imagine that red was kieslowski s last film and that she died at such a young age nevertheless the trilogy will always be her masterpiece and we will always remember her for her work that ranks right up with bergman fellini and wenders as a truly remarkable director who s never been awarded with an oscar kieslowski you have been missed	1
928	in the goofs section for this film there s a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where auguste s car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene this is incorrect one of the views is from auguste s flat the other is from valentin√© s flat across the street the whole purpose of this segment is to show how valentin√© and auguste   who may be made for each other   almost cross paths as happens several other times but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film and here there is the implication that joseph has manipulated things so that auguste is on that ferry having inspected valentin√© s ticket to see which sailing she is booked on	1
929	its my favourite film because there s so much going on that you don t see at first and so many things that make you wonder did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head for instance   is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being  also irene jacob as in the double life of veronique is outstanding there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things she does say are excellent such as her answer to valentine    be	1
930	valentine a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad they plan to meet up in england but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses one night after declining a pass made by her coworker she hits a dog named rita the dog survives and she returns it to her owner a hostile retired judge who s is living as a hermit and eavesdropper listening in on the conversations of all her neighbours she becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits her often often becoming part of her eavesdropping games one conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though the conversation between a young soon to be judge and her wife which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them as we find out more about the couple the man reveals more of her story then continues her story and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate little does valentine know how her life this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner allowing valentine to be the saviour of the young judge who is traveling the same path as her dear friend to prevent her from having such a grim future filled with loneliness and solitude it seems the old man s dream will come true after all and she can sleep with a smile on her face for the rest of her days an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time kieslowski never ceases to amaze me she is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema her use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art three of the most visually appealing movies i ve ever seen and her subtle connections between the three films are awesome usually signified with a subtle pause or late focus in a scene see if you can spot some i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying her happiness over the suffering which she dealt with for those many years i couldn t think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy	1
931	and there are not many in cinema history rouge seems to be a bit of a hope hope in mankind and in life but to say only that may be naive kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated  there s the new couple with the young judge after the accident  but what to say about this master of the camera you can t miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors ms jacob and mr tringtignant are perfect it s not only this movie but the downbeat thou shall not kill and a story about love that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist s point of view pity american public  the average one  could not see these films at least they are not in the maltin s dictionary and even the baseline does not know what to say about this unique man abel posadas	1
932	it is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of kieslowski s trilogy it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite view them in order blue white and red and consider them together as one complete work it is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes liberty equality fraternity and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry they are each well worth seeing independently but i believe they are best seen as one work collectively i would rate the trilogy as a 9 separately i place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994 the color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad the profiled model of which is the central of the movie s three main characters the other two characters do a double take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection this ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons i have called red a `mind bending  film this is the third of kieslowski s three colors trilogy based on the blue white red of the french flag and the three parts of its motto `liberty equality fraternity  the films stay primarily focused on these themes keeping with the basic levels of one two or three main characters yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal liberty blue to relational equality white to social fraternity red red is my favorite of these films and i give it a 9 it stands by itself as a great film but one should see blue and white first for the fullest effect	1
933	the final part of kieslowski s trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image in red imagery is paramount as well as the obvious but clever color coding however rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the  cinema du look  kieslowski s red is a multi layered densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love in red love and fate are intertwined but complex notions dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by you sense red is really an allegory a reenactment of prospero s omnipresent gestures in the tempest yet it is more than its story appears red demands countless viewings and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure although red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski it s best viewed as part of the trilogy elements of blue and white are referenced in red which knowing viewers will enjoy	1
934	this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s there s hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being  valentine irene jacob lives in geneva where she works as a model though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely one night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to her owner a retired jugde jean louis trintignant who is cynical and spies her neighbors phone calls disgusted by her she cannot go away and they meet again two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other  the story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship the actors are wonderful irene jacob and jean louis trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship  the topics are of an endless validity fraternity not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of privacy alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994 red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion used here as another protagonist it brings a unmatched depth to the movie a masterpiece	1
935	see three colors blue and three colors white they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors red red is a fantastic film it can be enjoyed in a single viewing and indeed the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing but watch it again once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie you will see new things with each viewing with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind with each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the french flag the story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect the facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer if you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films you may find red a bit slow you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom and yawning wonder what all the excitement is about this is not a mindless vicarious experience everything is not explained to you you must think as you watch you must see not simply look wonderful movie one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer	1
936	this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski   one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema she intended to retire after this film so in a way it is her artistic testament she died a couple of years after making the film and though it is said that she intended to return to directing destiny decided that this was indeed her last and what a film  rouge  the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film set in geneva one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge and durenmatt immediately comes to mind but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere in the lack of communication of the characters in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final which only a great artist could have staged little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times yes the film starts slowly and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers they deserve it the film gets quality as it advances and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters cinema quality is very original the image being a  study in red  as the title shows acting is fabulous with irene jacob and jean louis trintignant   the later in what will remain probable the best role of her old age  a great film seeing it again probably adds and i am happy to have it recorded on tape 9 10 on my personal scale	1
937	i feel at a loss so brilliant is this film kieslowski is a writer a philosopher and while an excellent filmmaker her greatness lies in her writing and red is her paradigm this film is a metafictional study of the artist s judgement in the creation of her fictional world of how an artist can attempt to remake life    even her own    thru her art even as she cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how she involves herself in her story it is still fiction and she is still outside of her remade world still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life she has tried to artistically remake and magically all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story this pre judged destiny if i had to choose i might nominate this the greatest film ever made	1
938	it s almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion in blue juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected in white an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle and now in red all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people s lives this young girl is appropriately named valentine a luminous irene jacob who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway not that she is without some baggage she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge jean louis trintingnant she does not want her i want nothing she coldly says and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparent free floating freedom conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people this male version of juliette binoche s character at first shocks valentine    she states she can only feel pity for her as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at her place and here is when she begins revealing who she is and her great loss at the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man auguste jean pierre lorit about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine    but they keep missing each other chance is the word like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and auguste s she has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather one of them happens to be the old judge she knows more about her than auguste does and she s never met her like god or prospero she is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again it s this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be different such is the case with valentine and the old judge i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom she did not meet    by chance or not    and is whether she knows it or not trying to make amends hence why she goes to the great risk of revealing her surveillance and becoming the social outcast but it doesn t end there one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow and karol fresh from her public humiliation sneers at her thinking someone is worse off than i am valentine is the one who helps her frailty in need can happen anywhere and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character now red is so much more than a story valentine the old judge auguste even rita the dog these aren t characters confined by storytelling an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed down ending red is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue julie s husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it s become clear she s emotionally dead in white dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite bardot s contempt looks on in red the old judge s tale of love and betrayal gets re enacted and all this time valentine s billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that rita the dog valentine s car struck bears seven pups life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love why do i say six you ll have to watch the movie and wonder	1
939	brilliant aussie movie a little slow at the beginning but once it gets going you can t stop laughing when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story and more so in particular the director and her mother obviously names have been changed i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family when i saw the movie somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening such a nice gentleman except for a particularly nasty incident with her ex brillian casting as well with sam neill and others a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry	1
940	i saw this film purely by chance it was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television i had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere it certainly isn t as good as educating rita despite a couple of additional twists and has a very predictable ending despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen her in many different films including dead calm the piano sirens children of the revolution event horizon bicentennial man and the ubiquitous jurassic park she was very good but she could have played this part with her eyes shut some of the acting was in my opinion dreadful rose byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example however two actors who i hadn t or don t remember seen before impressed me a lot sin√©ad cusackn as frances frank kennedy and especially matthew newton as her son david she in particular was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him	1
941	a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent director mark lamprell dealt with the potentially sob inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival australian film veteran sam neill was as always fabulous in the role of frank s uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying  you know bert newton matt s dad get out and see this movie	1
942	the australian public and the australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great aussie films around or that they are all the same well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other australian films it is unique   it will make you laugh out loud it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself the casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none the script and the photography colour light etc is wonderful but more important this is a great film i don t want to talk about the plot as i think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences take your girlfriend take your mum take your friends   for a great evening out 10 10	1
943	i can t see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 57 from imdb voters it s a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other catastrophes the sugar factory occasional coarse language russian doll sample people the secret life of us la spagnola strange planet fresh air dust off the wings doing time for patsy cline etc as a 19 year old uni student newton in perhaps her best role yet on par with changi at least with a bored over religious mother gets the shock of her life when she decides to enrol in the same course as her   and before you go thinking another goofy movie it s not there s some real substance here sure it s a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo jumbo aren t they and maybe the study of sinead cusack s character is a little muddled at times but the film is bright funny and has some important messages the principle cast is terrific cusack and newton are wonderful and rose byrne see her also in the goddess of 1967 is so underrated it s not funny she s a beautiful fresh confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives i gave my mother frank 8 10	1
944	my mother frank begins as a warm amiable comedy about a middle aged catholic woman frank short for francis played by sinead cusack who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son s university most of her friends and family are horrified not least her son matthew newton who is busy falling in love with her best mate s girlfriend rose byrne meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor sam neill matthew newton is utterly disarming as david relaxed and natural in the role even when the character s uptight she generates valuable goodwill steering the audience through some of the film s more awkward broad comedy moments not long after the half way point first time writer director mark lamprell expertly steers her film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces lynette curran sacha horler nicholas bishop and all the principals including a more animated than usual sam neill are excellent while it meanders a little towards the end my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd pleaser	1
945	the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the worldand this is one of the strongest exampleswith a running time at about an hourit contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on eartheven those who are hunting this type of moviesthree men and a woman are making a porn filmafter some normally shotswhich are pixelatedthe girl is tied upand the madmen cut her foodarm and tongafter thatthey make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestineshe is knocked unconscious too and has her penis cut offthe special effects are good for an obviously low budget productiononly the tong cut scene looks fakeand we can t talk about actingdirection or screenplayafter hearing a lot about this filmi was very happy when i finally found itthe first part is pretty boringbut the second one totally f***k up my mindthe torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seenthe gore hounds will be satisfied by tumbling doll of fleshbut an unknowing viewer shouldn t even read the synopsis	1
946	tumbling doll of flesh aka niku daruma and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back it s never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd r which i m quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch	1
947	first of all  you should watch this only if you don t mind the lack of subtitles  pornography  kinky sex and utter  horrifying and truly shocking depravity  i mentioned kinky sex  but to call sex in the second half of the movie  kinky  would be a great understatement  it s more like a punch in the face if you aren t prepared for this sort of sickness  that being said  i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo   snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese  the plot seems to be fairly basic  almost nonexistent  a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie  don t expect much in first 30   40 minutes  there is some dialog   if you don t speak japanese it s not going to mean much to you   that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew & performer  then there is some porn  straight sex   and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break  and then  it starts to happen  it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene   this time tied with the rope  the abuse begins  whipping  slapping  hot wax  in the end  girl breaks down and cries  they untie her  then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened   except for the girl  she is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave  she walks to the door  sits on the floor to put her shoes on  and that s when hell breaks loose  she is hit in the head with the baseball bat  her wound is treated  she is tied to the bed  what ensues can be briefly described  i m not going to spoil everything for you  as rape during dismemberment  think of  flower of flesh and blood   mix it with porn and you will get the idea it goes on for about 20 minutes or so  sfx are very good  makeup too  everything is shown  with no mercy for the viewer  you have been warned  i thought  visitor q  was a very sick movie  after watching  niku daruma  it looked like a fairytale to me this movie is so sick  so depraved  so twisted  so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it s finale  too bad it s released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available  but the movie still works without them  so  if you are into ultra sickness  extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre  check this out  i hope you won t have nightmares 8 10 	1
948	if you were enjoyed by watching guinea pig   then you ll like this movie to psycho the snuff reels is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements actually the effects are not so realistic like in guinea pig but its still pretty gory psycho the snuff reels contains 70 minutes of sex fetish and then torture scenes first 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie after that you ll see fetish sex scenes and last one is a torture scene the guys torture and rape girl   they cut off her legs hand tongue in the end guy rapes girl in her stomach  and after that other guy beat her and cut off her balls sounds pretty sick isn t it  like i said   it s pseudo snuff movie psycho the snuff reels is pretty rare japanese movie and as i know it s really hard to find it but if you are crazy about that sort of films i believe that you can find it	1
949	tumbling doll of flesh by tamakichi anaru is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abusetorture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actionstypically twisted japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gorethere is no plot to speak ofjust plenty of hard core sex scenesoptically censored againand lots of bloodthe special effects are quite impressive the dismemberment of japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detailthe tongue cutting scene really made me squirmher arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestinespsychothe snuff reels actually reminds me guinea pigflowers of flesh and bloodbut it s not as memorableso if you re a fan of ultra depraved japanese sickies like all women are whores or raping my virgin slave give this one a look8 out of 10	1
950	the word ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli danda a precursor to cricket in india the use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish as it signifies one who is sharp fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way ghilli is one of the best movies for vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action the movie never slacks for a moment and keep you always with some exciting action the movie is set in madurai and chennai and its story core is simple a rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in her town and her unquestionable power and authority prevents the girl from seeking a justice the hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens a very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new the director and the actors receive praise for the full paced action	1
951	if u haven t seen vijay in ghillli gilly or ghillie go watch it wow its devastatingly hilarious i don t know if dharani the brilliant director was being serious or not there are tons of hot guys in this one look out for someone who calls velu maacha the one with the brilliant braids devastatingly hot her teeth are brilliant as well vijay rocks trisha cries every 5 seconds it is very deep watch it you won t regret it there are some great laughs in this one if you don t speak tamil learn it then you will get all the inside jokes it is one for the whole family except maybe the violent bits should be skipped i ve seen this movie around eleven times  and counting wow	1
952	ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in her career as i had not seen the telegu movie so i could enjoy this movie even morethe story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her since she is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine vijay who had come to play a kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her the rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon s father s political cronies the movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player trishaashish vidyarthithe bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently a special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie prakashrajthe villain s character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well surprisingly for the first time i felt sympathy for the villain in the end the dialogue hi chellam has really caught on with the masses the music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song  apadi podu  is a rage all overdharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world	1
953	brilliant screenplay the screenplay is very tight that u will be gelled in seat this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no story needed story is very simple that u can write in one line but screenplay was amazing brilliant performance by vijay and prakashraj though plot is similar to okkadu director adapted only the plot tamil version is much fast paced than telugu movie travels straight without any chance of deviation though u can understand each and every characters back drop keep going	1
954	ghillie a remake of the telugu okkadu  is thankfully a clarified version of the original it packs the same punch and dharani true to her cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache a flagging vijay s career with the entry of the likes of surya and vikram on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on considering the choices she has been making since then the hard working actor seems to have lost her bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike the tightly snug script which runs at a neck break speed revolves around velu a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of kabaddi a popular game among boys in india the events following the chance encounter with muthupandi her rescue of the girl in distress and how she juggles with the aspirations of her friends and her own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie vijay fits as a  t  into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door trisha has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble with limited dialog s trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming of age to become a professional actress trisha became my personal favorite after this movie the movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including trisha s change in decision to leave the country prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter weight for vijay s role her almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero s armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing i give it a clear 8 out of 10	1
955	am an ardent vijay fan i have never seen another movie of her which is as good as this it has all the regular clich√©s that one can expect from a commercial entertainer a hero who is bad in studies but a star in her forte iekabbadi her friends to fill in the comedy quota a heroine in a life and death situation a villain which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist high octane chase and action sequences music that can make one dance and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle perfect the director doesn t give any chance for the audience to loosen up she just goes on from one nail on the head to the next and one can see the lighter side of vijay in this film which she rarely executes all saidthis movie was and will be perfect for many years to come	1
956	if you have seen the telugu version of gilli okkadu you will find this to be very similar in story line but gilli has different songs and takes place in tamil nadu not andra pradesh although this is a remake of okkadu you will find that vijay and trisha make this a unique film vijay and trisha make a great pair a few negatives were when vijays character slaps trishas character for going to buy a present for her she never apologizes and she still stays with her in the end good action and songs make this an all around great movie i recommend it i give it a 10 10 one of the best i have seen	1
957	i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as i m sure you know that malcolm s in the middle star frankie muniz and the ever so sweet amanda bynes the amanda show starred in this children s comedy as two friends that i m sure that we can all re late to the movie is about a boy jason shepardfrankie and her friend kayleeamandagoing onto an adventure in hollywood spoilers ahead as it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life s problems one day jason is hit by mr wolfthe big bad director jason s english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn her father s trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get her back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all she has to do is call jason s dad and tell her she stole her idea but the end is no real surprise being the good proveles and wins the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it s rated pg i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but it s good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it s innocent message i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isn t unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect	1
958	big fat liar is the best movie ever it is funny and cool jason shepherd frankie muniz proves that she was not lying and goes to los angeles to get her paper back from marty wolf paul giamatti along with friend kayleeamanda bynes mess up her life since marty won t call jasons  dad and say she wrote the paper yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch	1
959	well it might be a kid s movieperhaps but i m not gonna let my kids from 9 watch itso the one who say it is a kid movie hmmit is teenager movie i agreeso but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very goodso good that at the end nobody nows truth or lieanyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it  the truth is never overated  	1
960	i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious it s not like american pie or something i know not why people are offended by the universal plugs since it s part of the plot the advertising is excusable this is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral that thankfully doesn t get too sappy great acting and a cheesy ending minor spoiler the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy muniz who lies so much that no one believes her when the wolf giamatti comes along so she gets her best friend kaylee bynes and they go and drive the wolf crazy frankie muniz can be annoying in other roles but not as jason shepherd she handles the suave confidence of her character perfectly well and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness amanda bynes what more can i say the girl s got the gift she s funny talented versatile and very very attractive i m only 6 months older than her i need to get to california sometime soon in fact the  best friend  part was originally a boy but became a girl as soon as the makers saw amanda s interest which works out pretty well since the part would ve been pretty dull without the blessing of bynes s abilities paul giamatti is a very talented man while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical giamatti made her not just a jerk mind you but a likeable jerk a jerk that livens up the screen rather than intentionally dimming it and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf undergoes as well all in all great movie loved seeing jaleel white able to mock herself loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film one of the guests in the party scene is the director shawn levy another is bynes s former co star kenan thompson loved seeing amanda in those outfits get the dvd if you can it s got all kinds of great extra stuff and the lovely ms bynes is your guide through the menus 	1
961	who said it had to be believable do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film you ll enjoy the experience much more you ll find yourself forgiving some of the movie s more outlandish plot set ups and simply accepting it for what it is  a great family film i appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a children s film for once that to me is worth the price of the ticket and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it  older chidlren will enjoy this film enough good humor to keep adults interested very good film	1
962	fun movie great for the kids   they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if you re looking for something just to entertain don t expect to be seeing a classic	1
963	with all of the r movies out today it s hard to find something you can take the whole family to see my kids loved it it was good clean fun i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies	1
964	i wasn t expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script who then she travels to hollywood to get even but hey it s still a fun film frankie muniz of malcom in the middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as her friend is also very good yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film but i enjoyed it anyways grade b 	1
965	spoiler alert this was my son s review of the movie which she wanted me to posthe wrote this i swear with malcolm in the middle s frankie muniz and nickelodeon s amanda bynes they get to go to show business they team up on the actor paul giamatti she stole jason shepherd s essay on big fat liar and makes it in to a movie jason frankie muniz and kaylee amanda bynes have to go to la to get it back jason s dad does not believe that she wrote that essay so every time they see each other jason asks wolf paul giamatti to give jason s dad a call because she wants her essay back wolf does not make the movie but the president of the company makes it at the end the family and kaylee see the movie made by wolf pictures and based on a real story written by jason shepherd	1
966	after seeing big fat liar i think jason learned a lot more when she told the truth about marty stealing her story it was like the boy who cried wolf people heard her but they didn t believe her nobody did anything to help her besides not only marty s movies stink so does her advice the truth is not overrated i am so glad she got exposed for what she really is everyone found out that she stole from that boy including her parents not only she stole from that boy and lied about it she gave them someone else s work and tried to call it her own which is plagiarism doesn t she know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone s idea another reason why she got fired she is not trustworthy she s a liar a cheat a thief a crook and a plagiarist you got that marty you re a plagiarist plus you got everything that you deserved	1
967	big fat liar is a pretty funny movie but as i was watching it i thought about something some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable so really the film is kind of a big fat lie there is no way that she could ve gotten away with all of this here are all of the unbelievable stuff 1 when she fakes her father had choked on a meatball and acts like she is the father jasonfrankie munez couldn t have gotten away with that well luckily for us she didn t so it didn t stick with it the outrageous 2even if the grandmother was blind she still could ve figured out that that wasn t her granddaughter  3they couldn t have gotten on the plane flown to la acted like they were coat salesmen sneak into the studio and then and then well some of the film is a little unbelievable but it doesn t hurt to tell a little white lie trust me i do it all the time big fat liar though unbelievable at times is fun it s also very funny but let me just say one thing before i continue this review if paul giamatti wasn t in this movie it would really suck it would be horrible big fat liar is also pretty funny though corny at times i give it a thumbs up big fat liar*** ****	1
968	big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious overall a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time	1
969	big fat liar in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it when jason frankie muniz   malcolm in the middle and kaylee amanda bynes   all that played those tricks on marty paul giamatti   doctor dolittle i really smiled and felt good that s what i liked most about this movie as a matter of fact everything that happened after jason s essay erroneously ended up in marty s hands was hilarious i especially loved jaleel white s cameo when i first saw her i couldn t be certain but when i asked my mother if it was her she said of course before i wrap this up i d like to say like i said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth now in conclusion if you are a fan of frankie muniz amanda bynes or paul giamatti i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it	1
970	spoiler warning we ve all heard the boy who cried wolf legend but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world well it might be something like big fat liar fourteen year old jason sheperd  frankie muniz from malcolm in the middle  is always lying to keep herself out of trouble one day she is pressured to write an english essay but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film maker marty wolf  paul giamatti  who plans to turn jason s story into a hollywood blockbuster no one believes jason when she for once tells the truth and she ends up in summer school however jason is determined to prove to her parents the truth and travels to la with her friend kaylee  amanda bynes  when wolf refuses to admit she ripped off her story jason plans to make wolf s life a living hell bfl is no masterpiece but it s a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you re time i wished they could ve made it a bit longer though and there aren t that much pranks although they are clever enough  i like the pool dye the best  i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren t for paul giamatti she is simply hilarious in this if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out you might just enjoy it	1
971	i love this movie  yes the main character lies but that s why it s called big fat liar even though this kid runs away to hollywood it doesn t give kids the idea that they can besides she doesn t just do it for fun or to get away from anything she does it to regain trust  i don t think it was just one big ad for universal studios because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it s like for kids who don t know how cool movie making is  it has good music and fun characters this family comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike it has humour excitement and real life difficulties like lying in the end big fat liar sends out a moral don t expect lying to be easy	1
972	this isn t a life changing movie it s not an epic or anything like that but it s entertaining and it s fun it s a film that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are precious few kid suitable films that don t have a love story in them it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over the top special effects like lots of films these days are it s got some fairly good acting in and all the music that s been used fits in pretty well with the movie content the acting is quite good too the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny i d recommend it for people of all ages   it certainly made me laugh 	1
973	this is one of the funniest movies i ve ever saw a 14 year old boy jason shepherd wrote an english paper called big fat liar when her skateboard was taken she had to use her sister s bike to get to the college on time and she hit a limo when she went into the limo she met a famous producer from hollywood marty wolf when she left the limo she forgot one thing her paper so marty wolf took it and she turned jason s english paper into a movie when jason admitted that she left her paper in the limo and marty took it her parents and her english teacher didn t believe her so jason and her friend kaylee had to fly to los angeles to go to hollywood to make marty admit she stole her story to jason s parents when jason told marty to call her dad that marty stole that paper marty tricked her and burned her paper jason got so angry that marty burned that paper so marty called security to get jason out of her site jason and kaylee realized marty isn t going to admit the truth in order to take marty down in phase 2 the takedown jason and kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when marty jumps in her body turns all blue and it wouldn t come off then they put permanent orange dye in marty s shampoo and when she uses it her hair turns all orange and it wouldn t come off too finally they put lots of glue on marty s earpiece to make her call jason s father and when marty uses it it sticks to her ear it was funny when marty s hair and body turns all blue and orange and her headset is glued to her ear after that they tricked marty by telling monty who is marty s assistant that duncan moved to a house where there s a party going on when marty went in to see duncan she was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat her up when marty was in the house jason and kaylee switched the controls of her car when marty drove her car she knew all the controls were switched and she didn t know which button to push she s stupid enough to fall for it when marty hit the rear end of the masher the masher wrecked her car it was so funny so marty starts to call jason s dad and tricked her again she was on the phone but it wasn t her father she called security after the security got jason and kaylee out of marty s site they suggested them to go home monty was going to be on jason and kaylee s side cause she knew that marty was a liar and a jerk so she told rocco who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids jason told her father the truth of what she s been up to for the past 2 days and had her parents come to la when monty came to the kids she s going to help the kids move into phase 4 the payback jason splits the crew into 3 teams for phase 4 one team will distract and trick marty until jason s parents get to the set marty first rode with frank jackson but her car broke down so she rode with jaleel but she took her into the desert and leave her there when marty was in the desert a helicopter came to rescue her after that one of the blades are jammed so marty and the pilot got off the helicopter after that she was on the way to the set and when jason saw her marty stopped and saw what jason has her monkey so marty went after jason and kaylee and when they saw lester she released the water and when the water came it pushed marty away marty was still after the kids and when kaylee went the other way jason led marty to the top of the apartment building at the top jason was challenging marty by making her admit the truth and marty will never ever tell the truth when the crew caught marty in surprise all the people including jason s parents who were at the set knew what marty did marty was going to kill jason but the only way for jason to escape is jump down from the top after that her parents believed her that marty took her story when the people who were on the set left this is the end of marty at the end jason s story big fat liar was a movie i cant get enough of it	1
974	i could watch this movie all day i love it probably my all time favorite movies but by the way badger1970 there are a few parts with bad language not too bad but it s not exactly g rated great movie i recommend it to everybody any way it s making me type 10 lines of text so i am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment okay still typing this is getting annoying ugh i still have four more to go anyway watch this movie even if you have already seen it i don t care has it been 10 lines yet nope only 2 more lines left i don t even know why it wants me to do this i think i am done wait a minute i m not done sorry people i know it s torture listening to me well i suppose that you don t have to read this comment but you should because i wrote it i am probably done now finally bye	1
975	much better than expected good family flick   catch it on reruns the whole is more than the sum of its parts paul giamatti chews up the scenery   she has way more talent then the role deserves a treat to watch inspector uhl from the illusionist go over the top the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches the cameos were particular fun for the parents   nice to see lee majors and urkel umm jaleel again it s going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film  but let s hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting i normally can t stand frankie muniz but she is just fine here hats off to the casting director   if only for hiring giamatti	1
976	i can t understand why imdb users would rate this movie 52 10 it really is great very funny i would strongly recommend this movie for all of you adults teenagers and especially children  the story is about a 14 year old kid who always tell lie at home and school one day she had her homework of writing a 1000 word story but she didn t so the teacher told her to write it and gave her in 3 hours or she would have to go to summer school yep she wrote it in 245 big fat liar i think it was a story of herself on the way to the school she hit a limo of a famous hollywood producer and she gave her a ride but the kid forgot the story in the limo she told her parents and the teacher but of course they did not believe her and the movie producer she took the kid s story as her new movie big fat liar when the kid saw the trailer of the movie she told her parents she had written it but they didn t believe so she and her friend had to go to la to prove one thing the truth is never overrated  enjoy this great movie you won t be disappointed don t trust the 52 10 rate it should be 9 10 believe me  p s so sorry my english isn t good enough to make a better comment	1
977	i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot she would probably say it was easy but she really does a great job and should have won something for it we ve had the dvd for several years and my kids boy now 4 1 2 and girl 9 will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that i don t mind having to hear it in the background and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard	1
978	this movie was fun especially if your between 8 and 15 frankie muniz and amanda bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it paul giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to  get  my 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it parents no really bad words or any sex to worry about recommend it for the  right  crowd ap	1
979	big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing great production and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap the two stars work great together and  what can i say amanda bynes shines putting irkel and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches watch this film with your kids if you don t laugh throughout it you must not have been paying attention	1
980	i saw this movie on my flight from philly to denver the screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 x 10 so i really wasn t going to watch it but i like malcolm in the middle so i thought i d watch just a few minutes next thing i know i m sucked in having a great time and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by i agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment being one of the older baby boomers i was also pleased to see lee majors with a role in the movie as with a couple of other actors who were famous jamiel yesterday but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves it s your basic kid is wronged kid gets even and then some and everyone enjoys themselves in the process no heavy thinking no great analysis needed just a good fun way to pass the time 35 out of 5	1
981	big fat liar comes as a welcome    shallow but welcome    breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms bodily fluids pets on acid gaseous jokes and crotch gags after all see spot run max keeble s big move and snow dogs had signaled the degenerative spiral of kiddie movie making worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of not another teen movie and slackers written by nickelodeon producers dan schneider and brian robbins who coincidentally co starred on the  80s sitcom head of the class the film stars frankie muniz as jason who s always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes where s the english paper dad choked on a swedish meatball her teacher sandra oh issues an ultimatum turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school jason whips out a story called big fat liar and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive hollywood producer marty wolf paul giamatti wolf gives her a ride but jason leaves her paper behind no one will hear the truth this time and dad tells her she s lost her trust months later jason and best friend kaylee amanda bynes see a movie preview for big fat liar and head off to los angeles to wreak havoc on wolf s life    all to get a confession that she stole jason s paper to make the film they even gain the sympathy of some of wolf s abused employees including her assistant amanda detmer former chauffeur donald faison movie star jaleel urkel white playing herself and stunt coordinator a much aged lee majors because big fat liar is without the edge that her sitcom malcolm in the middle is known for muniz is easy to root for but doesn t have much to work with likewise for bynes who headlines her own tracey ullman like sketch show on nickelodeon all the hamminess is given to giamatti whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult the film gets snaps just by attempting the high road and should be enjoyed by its target audience especially since most of the high jinks occur on the universal studios lot but here s one head scratcher the message is that it pays to tell the truth but didn t we just see jason getting to her payback by telling white lies throughout the film well at least there s no poop	1
982	this movie is really an entertaining good clean fun movie for the kiddies kaleyplayed by nickelodeon s talented amanda is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth she eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen i won t bore you with the details if you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie i highly recommend this one	1
983	okay i ll admit that if i didn t have kids i never would have seen this film and would never see it but considering all the rotten kids movies i have seen such as spy kids 2 or babe pig in the city this is a significant improvement and it had enough in it that i wasn t totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide something i did repeatedly in the other two movies sure the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly  but it is a kids film and compared with other films in the genre this is definitely better than average frankie muniz and amanda bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty  at least on infomercials or doing voice overs so if you are looking for a film to see with your kids you certainly could do a lot worse	1
984	it is a nice comedy it has the great features of the childhood lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles the casting is great great acting and the special effects  well some stunts are really impressive watch it 	1
985	for a tv movie this was definately worth seeing all the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme i have not read seen the original and as a rule i can t stand shakespeare but i enjoyed this moviethe civil war setting was very well done as well dont expect to see an epic however you should find it moving enough to enjoy by the way on a side note don t compare this or any other movie for that matter to the original work movies aren t supposed to transfer a book to the screen but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it when people say the book was so much better they re usually wrong anyway what they are really trying to say is the book was so different	1
986	never having read or seen the bard s original work i can t begin to compare this work to her story so i won t instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects and some that looked a little lower in budget but still decent enough to enjoy i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing but i thought it was well done	1
987	but it s still an entertaining tv movie the transposition to the civil war makes a nice change of pace and adds a few subtexts such as ariel s servitude to prosper prospero that you might not otherwise see thankfully they didn t try to make it a mini series at 90 minutes it s just about right	1
988	this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet s bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat   the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold it s as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master s work a very rare type of film these days   it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative superficial shortcuts	1
989	can t grade this very well because i can t say i liked it but it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film the acting directing atmosphere music were all good it s just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can t truly relate to the movie ends it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don t need to make any sense at all and still be strong but that s about it the plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex girlfriend she is married brings her wife and later the kid while the ex knightley marries some other guy but the tension is there dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full bottom line you have to be in the mood to like this film the hard part is defining this mood i don t think i ve ever been in it yet ever so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas	1
990	although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas i know nothing of her life whatever her life and specifically her marriage involved i would imagine that the edge of love based on the novel manipulates things a bit but unless you are a historian or a poet who cares the movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in her life one is her wife kathrine and the other is vera who was her first love one romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot now grown up they are good friends i forgot to mention that this is set during the war vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who she gets her pregnant and leaves for war while she is away vera starts to fall for thomas again and kathrine has fallen out of love with her she is also carrying another man s child things get even more emotionally complex when capt killig returns as you can see it is a very soap operatic plot and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue but all is not lost yet for a non  hollywood production i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances hollywood production or not some of it has to do with being set during the war which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial a bit like atonement this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe wright s oscar nominee but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression things are okay at the start and finish but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story  i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer but is a good film to check it might even make a good date night movie considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today	1
991	given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern anglophone poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a drunkard a bad father a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits any way i found the other male hero of the story captain cillic a more endearing character the two female roles were played by actresses knigtley and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2 another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age old conventions can easily be surpassedthe atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it s possible political outcomesi think one would recommend such a movie	1
992	this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that it s also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around her at this particular stage in her life the movie s timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping you re not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley s characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by suggs of  madness   despite all of this it s a rather slow movie coupled with the fact it s just shy of two hours it s quite a slog to get to the conclusion overall it s a solid non fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well known british names behind the scenes but it really does drone on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 7 10	1
993	i did not expect to enjoy this in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn t credited knowing dylan thomas and really being appreciative of her poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man i didn t feel i needed to see a twee adaption of her lame bohemian life laid bare and this was not it critical and yet appreciative it was it made me cry kiera knightley was superb even with that slightly strained welsh accentand it is a sad tale that they tell dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly she was not throughout her life and neither really are the so called  feisty woman  of the pr spiel it is cillian the william of the movie a man that leaves the woman she loves to fight a war that they ignore her challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less and well that is how it was marketed it is not a film about dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it	1
994	this film flopped miserably in the uk and it didn t deserve to the trailer of this film is slightly misleading and i guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was atonement part 2 while the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of joe wright s bafta winning film it s very different in tone it focuses on an imagination of sorts of welsh poet dylan thomas  life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and her subsequent return to wales director john maybury quickly introduces dylan s matthew ryhs childhood sweetheart vera phillips played by keira knightley she was dylan s first love in their homeland but the moment has passed and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory or does she vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in dylan s life queen of ireland love of my life mother of my child caitlin thomas sienna miller the three form a sort of menage a trois in war struck london but vera then falls for a dashing soldier william killick cillian murphy they quickly marry with killick leaving for war a frightened vera convinces the thomas  to return witb her to wales but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of vera s child william s jealousy and shell shock after returning home and caitlin realising she cannot share dylan with her best friend filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else it works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed the performance of sienna miller is particularly excrellent unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she s quite a talent and knightley and murphy are once again very good the let down is rhys as dylan who while the welsh poet herself was no bed of roses lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan the writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness it s certainly worth watching however	1
995	keira knightley and sienna miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of dylan thomas knightley is thomas s boyhood sweetheart she re encounters during the blitz meeting at a bar they reconnect however things become complicated when thomas  brings her wife miller along the next time she meets her the women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become knightly s husband this further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face beautiful to look at extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted everyone disappears completely into their roles this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears it s so nice to see a film about adults being adults on a purely visceral level i really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing rarely have i ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted the trouble with the film is i m not entirely sure of everything that happened something seemed to be missing and a couple of times i had to replay the film to see if i missed something its not bad but its not completely satisfying as a result i tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but i couldn t find anything still i think this is a film worth seeing it s a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done	1
996	welsh poet dylan thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing her bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in whitehall thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance thomas writing and reciting her poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end resting somewhat uncomfortably on her society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran who had shot up her house and who was incidentally married to the woman she had been having an affair with the real story of this film is the love of two women one keira knightley whose first love was thomas matthew rhys the second sienna miller who is thomas s wife at times it reminds of the singing detective as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity	1
997	where would hollywood have been without fredric march as robert browning or dennis price as lord byron famous lovers in their day even an actor as normally straitlaced as michael redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of wb yeats writers  lives are an endless source of inspiration but of all poets it was dylan thomas the roistering free loving welshman who enjoyed a pint or two and drank herself to death in new york at the age of 39 who was closest in spirit to the film industry during world war ii she produced scripts for british propaganda documentaries she even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called the three weird sisters in which three old maids in a welsh village plot the murder of their rich half brother all that is now forgiven in john maybury s the edge of love thomas is played by the welsh actor matthew rhys it s not a full scale biopic the film covers four years in the poet s life during world war ii when she lived with two women her wife caitlin sienna miller and a former lover vera phillips keira knightley whom she met again by chance during the war it seems she loved them both the relationship of these extraordinary women    to thomas and to each other    is at the heart of maybury s absorbing film how it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves rebekah gilbertson the film s producer is the granddaughter of vera phillips and william killick william a war hero played in the film by cillian murphy married vera while she was still in love with the poet gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents dylan thomas a farm two mansions and bungalow by david thomas describing their tangled lives sharman macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of knightley the part requires knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed we begin in london during the blitz bombs are falling sirens are wailing and phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground tube station in a pub by chance she meets thomas and discovers after all these years that she has a wife and child phillips and caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs listening to thomas read her poems exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world my first was augustus john she seduced me when i was 15 but it s the refined and soulful phillips who stirs thomas s deepest responses and eventually succumbs to her charms in the meantime she has reluctantly married killick who has seen her in the tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty if not her singing it is an intense and strangely beautiful film though thomas herself may be its least impressive character she is best remembered for under milk wood her verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical welsh village of llareggub whose name spelt backwards was not something polite english teachers drew attention to i once had a vinyl recording of richard burton reading the poem she appeared in a film of under milk wood in 1971 and i ve never forgotten the creamy seductive quality of her voice the legendary charisma the magnetism of the man is something i missed in rhys s performance thomas comes across as a strangely pallid even secondary figure compared with the women in her life in her previous film love is the devil maybury explored the turbulent life of painter francis bacon and her sadomasochistic relationship with her lover and model george dyer the edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film if you ask what insights it offers into the springs of thomas s creative inspiration i would have to say llareggub but as an insight into her egotism her smouldering moods and her general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealing thomas had a good war boozing and writing while other men including killick were being traumatised by the horrors of battle in one scene near the end thomas s behaviour towards her friends seems unforgivably callous but this is not after all thomas s film murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war miller is charming and pathetic as the wife and knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real as she did in pride and prejudice but this is probably her finest performance and in every respect the film is worthy of her	1
998	with its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye kira this is re atonement  this a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of ww2 poet dylan thomas philanders her way between wife and ex in dark and smoky blitz london and later in windy wales  vera s ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share an easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace would work well with french subtitles but then i may have been to too many art house movies lately	1
999	from the start of the edge of love the viewer is transported to the striking world of ww2 london we follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity except one of the characters is named dylan thomas perhaps the greatest english poet of the 20th century and her reactions to the world around her were not only selfish but at times truly despicable  this movie is based on thomas  writings about love and romance these were adapted with a sharp screenplay by sharman macdonald keira knightley s mother the director john maybury does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people  all four are performed very strongly sienna miller is dylan s wife keira knightley is the cabaret singer vera phillips matthew rhys is dylan thomas and cillian murphy is william killick the first section of the movie takes place in london during the nazi air raids with vera being pursued by willaim a soldier waiting for deployment by a chance encounter dylan meets with her first love vera from there vera meets caitlin dylan s wife while the three are drinking william successfully breaks vera s guard  the film follows their lives as vera and william are married and she is sent to war vera has become pregnant and returns to wales with dylan and caitlin there they face a gritty existence with vera supporting dylan and caitlin with her husband s war pay through these times vera s and caitlin s friendship grows so does dylan s infatuation with vera she gives in this creates the first test for the two women  when william returns from war she barely recognizes her wife and has no bond with her infant son things get worse as dylan idly watches her friend struggle with battleground fatigue post traumatic stress disorder william realizes something has happened between dylan and vera and in a drunken rage shoots up dylan s house edge of love starts as a stylish romance in war torn london and ends in the stark gritty life of motherhood infidelity and attempted murder in wales the treatment of ptsd is well done and should speak to an american audience some day see ending each star has a great moment miller when she is yanking out stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man s child knightley and murpy when she finally bonds with her son oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome and rhys when she purgers herself on the stand to get vera s husband sent to jail  yet the real star of the movie is jonathan freeman s cinematography and john maybury s direction they seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time and they cherish their scenes with stunning shots while this isn t best picture material it is a very good movie much more engaging than the dutchess it has a visual lyricism that accentuates the use of thomas  poetry also this is clearly knightley s second best performance of her career and perhaps miller s best  i have always had a weakness for the artist in struggle whether it s hulce s mozart or hoffman s capote but i was stunned at how little sympathy i felt for dylan thomas her struggles with alcohol are well known but her antagonism of william and caitlin to gain possession of her first love vera makes her out to bea bad man so is this academy award worthy clearly no at least not this year it will be released state side in march 2009 making it ineligible for the academies this is 9 months after it was released in britain between atonement miss pettigrew and brideshead revisited the us has had its fill of ww2 british period pieces too bad this film is better then the other ones except atonement but in this one knightley s soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her	1
1000	i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character *******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when she had the chance ****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards	1
1001	despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isn t too sticky and pink because love is as a rose with thorns that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth  the music and lyrics of the cabaret chanson esquire songs sung b keira knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it √≠s mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy  london gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger  maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story	1
1002	i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character *******spolier alert******** i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when she had the chance ****end spoiler***** keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards	1
1003	so keira knightly is in itso automatically we compare this film to attonement aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally different the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche s damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved go on give it a go	1
1004	can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to    extend everyone s knowledge of herself and the world around her bob dylan named herself after her so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller her feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves her from a street brawl and then there s her childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she s caitlin s closest friend william s wife and like a muse the  star  in dylan s dark sky it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of her vices she must experience them all fully she introduces her beloved wife then continues to woo vera the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it s pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don t want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan s memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children s interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth   in the hours in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film the film s colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting vera s lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but vera s lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetry s juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day constant echoes of dylan s poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i ll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died ¬ñ ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera we re still innocent in dylan she says there s a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year	1

1007	i am a huge fan of harald zwart and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i can t say i m a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it bj√∏rn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year  if you re only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one	1
1008	this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away norway is known for making crappy movies no offensebut i had a good feeling about this one even thou i m not interested in football i wanted 2 see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you re ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one	1
1009	i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time  i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen well done	1
1010	hehehe this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves harald zwart is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool s it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006 and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn t stop laughing i haven t had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one  recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it	1
1011	i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80 s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i m not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to it s franco italian producersand the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece	1
1012	despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesn t quite reach the level of joe d amato s similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombie s al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye  i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less than spectacular finale much like d amato s emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don t get your hopes up there s no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn t help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by	1
1013	gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure sex movie she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise they have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret society tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony the scenery is gorgeous deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored the imagery is very similar to that of the movie black emanuelle it is rich and colorful recommended	1
1014	i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it what s great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn t really matter the pace in languid and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous there s one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i ve ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser the pilot flies over the city to pick up her girlfriend  and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al cliver is filming all of this with her 16mm camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with her bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn t so silly speaking of drag another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and her two wives a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact orso keeps her clothes on for almost the entire film even when she s with annie belle this is another minor complaint about laure there s nudity but it s not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments laure is actually very watchable i love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today ps make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt which stars annie & al but also another famous screen couple laura gemser and gabriele tinti the music in that movie is also great	1

1016	distributor goodtimes home video  plot a pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for tv movie gail osborne is new in town she makes friends has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way that is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting after more and more phone calls she is raped throughout most of the movie she tries to find proof that the person did rape her audio video this 1987 vhs edition from goodtimes stinks there are constant lines at the bottom and top of the screen extras no extras from goodtimes home video final thoughts this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978 so don t expect many deaths there are none if you can find this movie with the worldvision home video logo on the front then buy it but the goodtimes version is pretty crappy this can be a little boring but if you are patient the ending is pretty good	1
1017	there is a lot to like in this film despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes i for one was sure it was the teacher in fact that would have been more probable plot wise because the idea of the best friend s boy friend kind of came out of nowhere i guess the point of that is that rape is omnipresent you never know who it is going to be ms beller is luminous as always yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement like all preachy films the plot lasts 15 minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip blythe danner as the mom is in the role she was born to play the fretting over protective mom some good 70s scenes for 70s fans the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away her pain is all dark stained beams barrels oak and cork a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of 70s high school melodrama or 70s kitsch in general	1
1018	are you in the house alone belongs to the pre cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows it is well made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared tony bill and blythe danner play beller s parents ellen travolta john s sister is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of her earliest roles as a cocky rich kid it s a competent chiller with a still relevant social message beller is lovely   if you are 30 or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters blythe danner who i usually don t like gives a truly moving performance nice little film	1
1019	okay i love this movie i watched it over and over again it is so hard to tell who the attacker is you keep thinking it s one person then another then back to the first person then another person it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is summary gail osborne is raped and left at her home she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend to her teacher who takes a liking to her to her ex boyfriend all different stories all suspects but who did it i love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb if it comes on tv watch it *** 1 2 stars 10 10	1
1020	doe eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie the film then flashbacks to the few days before the rape as beller is harassed by a stranger beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson and dennis quaid are double dating early on beller s anxious parents laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner wait at home wringing hands and so on right away the 1970 s makes its dated entrance as the young couples discuss the romance and love in three days of the condor beller an amateur photographer begins getting threatening notes stuffed in her locker at school the film makers wisely give us a whole slew of suspects beller s new boyfriend mattson s boyfriend beller s dad beller s ex boyfriend and what about that overly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be a little more sexy in her self portraits i knew who the rapist was because the worldvision video company video box has a picture of the attack on the back cover destroying any suspense in that regard without giving away who the attacker is beller begins getting harassing phone calls and is eventually raped the movie then heads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets up a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student finally the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that day and age the suspense here is very real without going over the top into scary movie stuff beller is very good and watch for her and mattson s scene in an abandoned theater  both do great jobs the film is full of familiar faces including ellen travolta in a small role and everyone is professional this was made in 1978 and it shows i am sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overcritical horror movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the morning but some of the attitudes here are embarassing the teacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain what exactly she had in mind nowadays if any high school teacher said that then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own after beller is raped the rapist is still a part of her life as warrants are issued blah blah blah there may not be a case because beller is not a virgin and cannot prove she was raped by whom she said many of these problems have been addressed with modern technology and policing efforts but this film obviously knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate rape is an act of violence that has not gone away but efforts today to catch the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago the problem is the anti rape angle feels tacked on like an afterthought before that we have a tight little suspenser that has real honest to god characterization after the rape everything changes filmwise and not for the better i remember beller from the  70 s and  80 s and who could forget her revealing role in the betsy but she has not done anything in almost ten years this is a shame since she was very good way back then i will recommend are you in the house alone based on the acting alone with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the film if you want to relive 1970 s made for tv high school life this is your cup of tab this is unrated but contains physical violence some sexual violence and some adult situations	1
1021	an enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy s  rites of passage  but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here i was a bit disappointed the period was captured but the plot was desperately thin the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible and without that nada the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot   all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story   which surely suggests a fundamental flaw when all your sub plots look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits nevertheless it s a benign movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final  cut  that good feeling permeates the film and that has to count for something a flawed really quite good movie 7 out of 10	1
1022	i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was the school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school a crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke  getting the whack  some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes after that they were kept in a safe and as for certain nocternal activities what can i say the film actually came out in 1982 i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time if you like british films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you another film very much like it  swalk  came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again also  kes  is in the genre highly recommended but trust me 1982 is when it came out	1
1023	although i don t like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago i still think it is one of the best coming of age movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch i saw the opening titles of that movie and theni was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing her dream girl no offense but if that was an american movie you would certainly see at a certain point mainly climax  the shy boy making love to her girl and i really can t grasp this contradicting concepts till nowi have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memoriesthanks	1
1024	postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience her first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and her world of the 1940 s free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots maintain character interest ala gregory s girl and plenty of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be does she ever get her wish watch it and see	1
1025	there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around  that 20 years later  it wont hold the same magic as it did before i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised p tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess it is engrossing  it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that john albasiny and abigail cruttenden s rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me p tang yang kipperbang eehhh 10 out of 10	1
1026	just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini series published in 1981 it was not available on dvd until the last few years since then it has become available but initially only in the british format for which i bought an  international  dvd player which you have to hack  illegally i suspect to see it but the series is now available through amazoncom  3 discs   for between $19 21 to be viewed on dvd in the us format no hacking there were 41 reviews average 5 stars this mini series is one of the very best on oppenheimer or the manhattan project or virtually anything produced by the bbc	1
1027	like an earlier commentor i saw it in 1980 and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam waterston s finest work she and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero    which she was    but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype	1
1028	>>> great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for 31st july 2006uk   there is also a scheduled release in states   don t know the date   can t wait   <<<< >>>> below is my original comment <<<<< i agree with all the other reviewers   it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd the story line is gripping   the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling  over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns  it s very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production  i m going to email one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens who did the production  was it bbc  rw	1
1029	insanely well crafted mini series i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early mini series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was 6 8 hours total this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours cut some interesting but slow scenes i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this point would fit in very well in the mini series or dramatic history genre	1
1030	oppenheimer was a great series it was the first thing i saw waterston in and it is too bad copies aren t available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of insulin i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger uxb a series about defusing unexploded bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library pete	1
1031	 oppenheimer  with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as evard teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2 and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if she were really present at los alamos and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project the only downside is that this is a british production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent the skill of current day australian & irish actors taking on non native dialects is amazing the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes  definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb sadly the mini series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion  oppenheimer  compares favorably to the more recent  fat man & little boy  feature film with paul newman as leslie groves the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered and dwight schultz alumnus of tv s  a team  as oppenheimer as a mini series  oppenheimer  is around 4x as long as the newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage	1
1032	president harry s truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don t know seven years before richard rhodes  superb pulitzer prize winning the making of the atomic bomb the bbc produced a seven part miniseries oppenheimer that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the atomic age permanently joining science and technology to the state and in particular the military not merely making history but changing the world forever the production is impeccable the casting nothing short of miraculous not only the main characters but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed in particular are sam waterston in the title role of american physicist j robert oppenheimer scientific director of the manhattan project who was based at the los alamos nm laboratory the site for which she personally chose manning redwood as general leslie r groves who oversaw the entire manhattan engineering district the project s formal name david suchet as physicist and ultimate nemesis of oppenheimer edward teller who nearly forty years later whispered into ronald reagan s ear and brought us the strategic defense initiative   star wars and jana sheldon as kitty oppenheimer the attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout part thriller part love story   and ultimately a tragedy this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history   and that of science   that we dare not forget highest recommendation note viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy jacob bronowski s 13 part series the ascent of man and the bbc film of michael frayn s play copenhagen	1
1033	i too found oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller as i recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good the only reason that the series doesn t rate a full 10 10 is for the low budget production values in some areas actual content is absolutely first rate in my recollection the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july 31st it will be a region 2 pal set but it would seem that a region 1 ntsc set should be soon in the offing if you have a universal player in the us you can order the series right now from amazon uk http  tinyurlcom znyyq huzzah	1
1034	i can t remember the series i believe it may have been american masters but it was broadcast on pbs around 1980 most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way you get to know the turmoil in oppenhemiers mind and how the development changed her life forever you understand the tragic figure she became and why with 7 episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and backstabbing i have contacted pbs about the chance of obtaining a video or dvd but have never received a response too bad i would love to see it again	1
1035	i watched this mini in the early eighties sam waterson proved herself to be a great actor in fact when she began law and order i was disappointed in her as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both factual and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read the book pppenheimer shatterer of worlds and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for her insight if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr waterston can really provide an audience enjoy the movies	1
1036	absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv it was both entertaining and informative the reason i found this site is an attempt to find out how i can again see it in the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with gen leslie groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the manhattan project most certainly she was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past  the casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding it was the first time that i noticed sam waterston as an actor except for height she looked very much like robert oppenheimer the early scene in which oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me	1
1037	i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can t get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots	1
1038	i posted on imdb on this series recently giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the bbd where one would write to appeal release i wrote to that address mentioning sam waterson and her popularity prominently i just received the following reply  from emilyfussell@hotmailcom subject oppenheimer date may 14 2006 14400 pm mdt to kk2840@earthlinknet  dear kate  i work for the bbfc the british equivalent to the mpaa and we classify dvds and videos as well as films in this country anyway i am currently in the process of giving a certificate to the 1980 miniseries  oppenheimer  while researching the work on the imdb i noticed your post and thought you might like to know that the work is about to be released hence the need for a certificate  i don t know which company is distributing it but keep your eyes peeled  kind regards  emily +++++++++++++++++  hooray  i also want to contact netflix re purchasing this  kate killebrew  kk2840@earthlinknet i emailed the bbc recently regarding whether their terrific series oppenheimer had ever been released on video or dvd i have not been able to find it i received the following reply if you do write the bbc be sure to mention that sam waterston is very popular in the us you can also enter oppenheimer 1980 on amazoncom and find a box to check to request release by the owner bbc and be notified when it s released  kate killebrew kk2840@earthlinknet here s the reply from the bbc dear kate thank you for your e mail regarding  oppenheimer  i was interested to read that you would like a copy of this programme which you have enjoyed i have checked the bbc shop and on line retailers and can find no record of it being available we are unaware of plans at present to release this programme on dvd however if you would like to make a suggestion can i suggest you put it in writing to the commercial arm of the bbc commissioning editor bbc worldwide ltd woodlands 80 wood lane london w12 0tt may i thank you again for taking the time to contact the bbc regards elaine hunter bbc information ______________________________________      original message      {comments} i am trying to find a copy of the terrific bbc production oppenheimer  a six part series made in 1980 with sam waterston from a book script by peter prince i watched parts of it then on pbs american playhouse but can t find it on video anywhere http  wwwbbccouk 	1
1039	a true geek girl s dream high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions very large explosions sam waterston is so natural in the role of oppenheimer that tapes of the real oppenheimer sound odd apparently she had a voice similar to ronald reagan the triumph and tragedy of oppenheimer is one of the 20th century s most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu drama ought to be the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves an interesting fact some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest a must see	1
1040	has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet i can see that a lot of people have inquired but i can t tell if any of them have been successful it s hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country how can this be true and what can we do to change it as an aside i agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site this is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway now we want to share it with our children  but we can t if that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information	1
1041	this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling  all the more so because it is true the writers did their homework  the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production either with pbs or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the us on american playhouse there is such an interest in seeing this  just hard to believe no one can make it available	1
1042	i ve always liked barbara stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the 30 s and 40 s although few of her movie roles are memorable today she is remembered most for the tv show the big valley stanwyck worked so much because she was durable it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence and so it was for christmas in connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn t even really about christmas it does however have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney greenstreet and sk sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today to begin the plot concerns a magazine writer stanwyck who the magazine s readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in connecticut but who is really single lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking could anyone get away with such a fraud even then apparently and even the owner of the magazine greenstreet is deceived although one would think that she would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck greenstreet a sailor recently survived from her sunken ship morgan and stanwyck s restaurateur friend szsakall find themselves spending christmas in connecticut at a farm belonging to stanwyck s boorish boyfriend reginald gardiner you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must gardiner wants stanwyck to marry her to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand her at all morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but she is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh meanwhile the incredibly naive greenstreet character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn t get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny haha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck thank goodness it was set at christmas or like 95 percent of stanwyck s movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew	1
1043	while it s not perfect it s close love barbara stanwyck sz sakall sidney greenstreet dennis morgan robert shayne superman s police chief the housekeeper the waiter at restaurant felix and the judgei can go on and on this movie has been part of my family s holiday tradition since i was a youngster and my children grew up with it too the baby swallowed the watch was always my son s favorite line sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly funny s z sakall dennis morgan has a few great songs too i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake blah	1
1044	i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist barbara stanwyck for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful connecticut home the trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have her and a ww2 hero as guests during the christmas holidays why is she worried because she lives in a small new york apartment isn t married and doesn t have a baby   and can t cook at all hilarity and romance ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face  keep from being fired by the magazine owner played by sydney greenstreet this is a delightful comedy one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers	1
1045	barbara stanwyck probably didn t think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark hairstyle if it wasn t a wig than the one she had to wear in double indemnity the year before that film while the premiere film noir and an all around great film gave her a great role but oh that hair here she is more chic and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a 40 s woman she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful martha stewart like columnist she writes a homey column in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is we meet her boss sydney greenstreet who has no idea that she is living a lie and when she pushes her way in for a christmas away at her supposed connecticut home she has to come up with a husband reginald gardiner and baby before we can say jingle bells hungarian chef sz sakall steps in to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one on one with irish una o connor it s not goulash it s irish stew sakall simply takes the paprika pours most of it in and says now it s goulash totally changing what she has prepared for lunch then when it comes to the flapjacks she flips and she scoops for years a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time pancakes come up in a conversation i don t flip i scoop she won t even flip just one for greenstreet saying i ve never flipped in me life o connor can get on the nerves when she screeches over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with sakall is very charming it is obvious in the romance department that reginald gardiner is not barbara stanwyck s cup of tea especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan who is a bit dimwitted when bathing the baby which eats soap causing stanwyck to get a bit alarmed she should suspect something instantly but doesn t but it doesn t matter the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sleigh comes up living in new york city after 25 years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at rockefeller center is exsquisit too there is something about looking out at a snow covered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer rabbits or other wild life this is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film remember the night an underrated gem add on the big city christmas of meet john doe and you ve found perhaps one of the busiest stars of holiday films around	1
1046	i ve discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise a christmas classicit s also one of the fine comedies of the 40s the story line is simple  elisabeth lane barbara stanwyck makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine at christmas time her boss alexander yardley sydney greenstreet asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the connecticut farm she write about the only problem is  she hasn t got any farm and she can t cook to get out of the jam elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend reginald gardinerwho has a farm and flies for connecticut with her wonderful cook uncle felix  there s a fine direction by peter godfrey and the cast is really wonderful  stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman greenstreet gardiner and sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters the only weak point is the leading man dennis morgan she starts well but as the movie goes on becomes really a bore one almost feels sorry for elisabeht lane to ends up with her rather than with gary cooper or david niven who both would have been more suitable for the part anyway this is a joyful christmas time movie with a refreshing score and i advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet holidaysin connecticut	1
1047	a magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a ny apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend christmas with her after a slow start it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy thanks to a fine cast in a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in double indemnity stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while greenstreet is well cast as the publisher however sakall steals the film as a chef trying to master the english language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible european accent	1
1048	this film reminds me very much of the later rock hudson film man s favorite sport  about a fishing writer who has never fished and is forced into entering a fishing tournament in this case barbara stanwyck is a martha stewart like writer who can t cook and doesn t really have the perfect family she describes in her articles  in fact she has no family at all well like rock she is maneuvered into performing  in this case creating a huge holiday dinner while vacationing in the countryside since there is no family she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tried desperately not to let the cat out of the bag that she can t do any of the things she is known for doing a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup	1
1049	add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars it is sweet funny and endearing	1
1050	this is a delightful they don t make em like this anymore kind of film well performed by everyone and peopled with interesting character actors an intelligent witty script acted with the right blend of broad comedy and understated humor holds up for repeated annual viewings **warning** the re make of this film with the same name directed by arnold whatwashethinking is an unbearable mess   painful to watch   without a scintilla of the charm and wit of the original	1
1051	christmas in connecticut is a gem of a christmas movie classic while lesser known than some others    it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time i watch it every year barbara stanwyck is perfectly cast as elizabeth lane the single career girl way before it was popular stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise her nyc apartment and her friendly uncle restaurateur around the corner typify the single girl in the city existence she can t cook yet she writes a homemaking column for a magazine dennis morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero jefferson jones who wants to meet the amazing elizabeth lane after being lost at sea all she wants is to spend christmas in a real home which sets up the delightful madcap story that evolves it is fun from beginning to end we should all have an uncle felix too	1
1052	christmas in connecticut is an absolute gem and a must see for christmas elizabeth lane a precursor to martha stewart is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers  the perfect wife mother and domestic goddess only thing is she is none of these things  a total phony unfortunately for her she is about to be found out her publisher mr alexander yardley a brilliant comic turn by sydney greenstreet gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to elizabeth s perfect farm for the christmas holiday only thing there is no farm perfect or otherwise the comedy involves how elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job elizabeth s colleague john happens to have a farm in connecticut so that solves that problem however she wants to marry liz but she does not want to marry her she offers her marriage though she knows she doesn t feel the same way about her that she does about her she makes the offer anyway and assures her that she is willing to wait and here barbara stanwyck as liz delivers one of the most devastating put downs i have ever heard with perfect innocence she replies could you wait that long ouch in addition the scenes between una o conner and sz sakall are hilarious they don t seem to like one another though one suspects they really do they are rivals in the household and sz sakall s mangled english is equaled by nora s strangled pronunciation of her name mr basternook my name is felix it is amazing how christmas y these black and white films are great character work by all involved don t miss this one	1
1053	stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens  christmas carol in its sensibility the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character yardley is the modern equivalent of dickens  scrooge in the way she exercizes control over her employees    until the christmas spirit overtakes her the role is a  walk in the park  for greenstreet who had been one of the stage s great falstaffs when she was part of the lunts  company greenstreet had only entered films five years earlier when at age 61 she was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film john huston ever directed  the maltese falcon   cuddles  sakall was probably never better in her traditional role as the embodiment of middle european gemutlicheit the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem	1
1054	i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food definite points go to sydney greenstreet for her performance of alexander yardley and also to reginald gardiner who played john sloane the impossibly boring fiancee truly a gem to be watched every christmas	1
1055	i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non holiday films as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it  stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts dennis morgan s acting is strong also she goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor check out kitty foyle in this film she plays the visiting sailor that woos stanwyck away from her husband to be  this is a christmas classic the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance	1
1056	though it s a christmas movie christmas in connecticut could have been done any time of year as it s the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a martha stewart type that s what she thinks in reality the lady in question portrayed by barbara stanwyck has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby she has no farm no husband and no baby nor are the many recipes she publishes hers they belong to the restaurant owner nearby when her no nonsense editor sydney greenstreet insists that she entertain soldier dennis morgan she enlists the aid of her boyfriend to use her farm and she transports herself and the restaurateur there there s even a babywell actually there s more than one chaos ensues and the charade becomes increasingly difficult to play out especially when stanwyck falls in love with morgan this is such a wonderful movie and even if you re gravely depressed christmas in connecticut can lift you right out of it barbara stanwyck is wonderful as the career woman turned homemaker despite not being as flashy as crawford or davis she was nevertheless able to do what any role called for   she could be cheap elegant warm nasty cold and or sexy and she makes it look easy on top of that she is always attractive and alluring dennis morgan is a handsome and charming solider as an added bonus she gets to use her irish tenor fianc√© reginald gardner is all business and you can tell she s not quite right for stanwyck sz sakall as the fake uncle real chef is hilarious especially as she prays stanwyck can flip a pancake before an audience i can imagine the impact this delightful film had at the tail end of world war ii it must have been a real beacon for the better times to come	1
1057	this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite which i try to catch on tv every year if i can it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane charmingly portrayed by barbara stanwyck however in contrast to martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever the other cast members effectively complete the story and include dennis morgan jefferson jones reginald gardiner john sloan and sydney greenstreet alexander yardley elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children in reality she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot boil an egg her recipes are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend felix elizabeth gets away with her deception until the publisher of her magazine alexander yardley decides she wants a nice old fashioned country christmas and invites herself to visit her bringing with her a returning war hero jefferson jones a sailor who had been shipwrecked yardley demands total honesty of her employees to get out of her predicament and save her deception based career elizabeth borrows the connecticut country home of her longtime architect suitor john sloan a dull fussy chap who has long sought marriage she also borrows a neighbour s baby actually several to pass off as her own and her  husband  sloan s of course this scenario makes for much merriment it s a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere whenever i think of this movie i picture the snowflakes falling the tree beautifully decorated the fire roaring in the hearth the turkey roasting and christmas cookies baking why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake i understand there is a 1992 version directed by arnold schwarzenegger and starring dyan cannon kris kristofferson and tony curtis i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday  must see  along with it s a wonderful life white christmas miracle on 34th street and of course all the versions of a christmas carol	1
1058	i have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favoritesit has all the charm 1940 s quaintness and good old fashioned romance and it s hilarious to boot barbara stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazineunder the premise that she is a married homemaker even the president of the magazine is under this delusion enter a handsome gi played by the talented dennis morganjust rescued off of a raft along with her buddy her simple wish is to stay at the homey inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home cooked meals she now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputationadd to this that her fianc√© is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn t help the humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun throw in the character actor nicknamed cuddles who fits this name completely it becomes even more adorable this has become my must see movie that i snuggle in with a cup of cocoa each christmas season a wonderful enjoyable movie to enjoy at christmastime or anytime	1
1059	barbara stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy about a sailor invited to spend christmas with a popular magazine writer s family at her farm in connecticut the problem is she has no husband baby or farm as she writes about in her column and she can t even cook her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend  uncle felix owner of a hungarian restaurant in new york city things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites herself along for christmas a scheme is hastily planned with her stuffy fianc√© providing an actual connecticut farm neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher isn t looking but when the handsome young sailor arrives on christmas eve romantic complications ensue as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice guy navy man and vice versa this is a charming warm film that deftly balances humor with sentiment and is a wonderful showcase for barbara stanwyck to display her considerable comedic talent aided by such marvelous character actors as sydney greenstreet una o connor szsakall and many others a christmas night dance at the town hall is a toe tapping delight to see and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for viewers who have seen her mainly as tough bitchy women in femme fatale roles truly a wonderful film that has stood the test of time	1
1060	personally i don t like a lot of b w movies but there s something magical about this movie  the movie starts with elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck liz writes a magazine column about how she s the  martha stewart  of connecticut of course she s lying this becomes a problem when her publisher mr yardley asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas in addition mr yardley who s going to be alone for christmas invites herself up to the farm for the christmas party from there things just go crazy since the movie is set on a new england farm the movie has a warm holiday feeling plus the characters are hilarious mr yardley is always shouting orders and liz s friend felix is always yelling  catastroph  when things go wrong finally the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end a jolly fat man laughs and shouts what a christmas  in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie	1
1061	this film is one of my favorite christmas classics sure it s fluff it s not relevant but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing no this movie is definitely a good thing as martha stewartappropriatelywould say barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her both of them have charm and warmth to spare they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40 s and 50 s  sydney greenstreet szcuddlessakall reginald gardiner and una o connor among them where are characters like this today not one role could have been better cast bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play this lightly she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect morgan is the essence of the nice guy because her part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook her skill just the fact that she could hold her own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but she too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones skip the ill advisedand pointless1992 remake and watch this bright sparkling holiday gift	1
1062	given the acting roles she played in the 1940s casper gutman signior ferrari mr peters jerome k arbutny ex superintendent grodman count fosco titus semple it surprises many of her fans to learn that originally sidney greenstreet made a name for herself in comedies in the west end and broadway she was usually such a total villain or serious actor to the public that her comic talents were ignored in fact she actually did make four comedy appearances one a spoof of her villainous portrayals with her villainy partner peter lorre in a cameo appearance her best total film appearance in a comedy was probably that of magazine publisher alexander yardley in christmas in connecticut although her autocratic half mad soap tycoon in the hucksters is a close second despite some problems with the screenplay it is a good film and usually revived in the christmas season elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck writes a column in american housekeeping magazine for yardley where she gives household tips and cooking recipes she is the 1945 version of martha steward except that ms steward is a cook and house owner and can vouch for trying out and testing what she advocates stanwyck can t her cooking recipes are those of her friend felix sz sakall a gourmet chef and restaurateur the house she describes as her home a model farmhouse in connecticut belongs to her unofficial boyfriend architect john sloan reginald gardiner gardiner really would not mind marrying stanwyck but she is not fully ready to consider a final commitment to her as the film begins an american is shipwrecked by the nazis this is jefferson jones dennis morgan a sailor she spends two weeks in a raft before being rescued sensing publicity value greenstreet decides to grant morgan s wish to have a genuine old fashioned christmas in connecticut she basically tells stanwyck that she will entertain morgan and herself at her farm for the holidays stanwyck is unable to explain that the columns image of herself complete with her ability to flip flap jacks and raise a baby she supposedly had with her husband is a lie   if she does she will be fired as will her immediate boss dudley beecham robert shayne in a moment of depression she accepts gardiner s proposal of marriage and then gardiner finds her connecticut home is dragooned into becoming the actual home of stanwyck and herself and their baby of course aside from putting off greenstreet s meddling curiosity stanwyck and morgan find that they are falling in love much to the annoyance of gardiner   she does actually expect that stanwyck will still marry her complication following complication occurs as lies piles on lies and as neighbor s babies succeeds neighbor s babies before greenstreet begins to wonder if she is missing something but it is a comedy so everything works out well even greenstreet at the conclusion is amused by the entire madness   her celebrated hearty chortle mirroring that of santa clause for a change this is not a classic comedy certainly not a great one but amusing enough for the season to be worth watching in december	1
1063	it s fun and fast paced as one falsehood leads to another and another toward an inevitable surprising conclusion the suspense separates this holiday flick from all others one wonders how the pieces are going to fit both during the movie and in the future the character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process sinkewicz frank jenks shows us what manipulation can getand ultimately what manipulation can cost uncle felix sz sakall sizes up each person for us while trying to protect lishka barbara stanwyck and this helps us decide who we are going to root for in the end if we could ever achieve a perfect world imperfect people would likely have to undergo a series of events such as these a glaring weakness is that fake baby cry after it allegedly swallowed uncle felix s watch i ve heard more authentic crying from a doll in a toy store watch it and you ll really feel like you ve been somewhere	1
1064	make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck this film is a fun one to watch they really work well together as you would see in this movie the whole cast was very entertaining since i m a dennis morgan fan this film was a real treat buteveryone can enjoy it recommended	1
1065	it finally hit me watching my vhs of christmas in connecticut what other film this one reminded me of if it weren t for the fact that the other was done 20 years later i d say it was a remake just as rock hudson was a phony fishing expert for abercrombie&fitch who had to get some on the job training at a fishing tournament barbara stanwyck plays an forties version of martha stewart stanwyck s a cooking columnist who s built up this whole image of living on a small connecticut farm with husband and baby cooking all these marvelous delicacies trouble is she s unmarried childless writes her column from her apartment in new york and doesn t know how to boil water but her writing is a hit with the public trouble comes when she s hijacked into cooking a home christmas dinner for a war hero sailor played by dennis morgan who gets to sing a couple of songs as well got to keep up the image at any cost and her publisher sidney greenstreet likes the idea so well that she invites herself to the dinner so with borrowed farm baby and reginald gardiner who d like to make it real with stanwyck she tries to brazen it through  christmas in connecticut s now a yuletide classic and deservedly so the leads are warm and human and they get great support from the assembled players sz sakall as the hungarian restaurant owner friend of stanwyck from whom she gets her cooking information and una o connor as the housekeeper have a nice chemistry between them reginald gardiner and stanwyck have no chemistry at all obvious to all but reggie and she s funny in her stuffed shirt way most people remember this film as one of sidney greenstreet s few ventures into comedy if she s not an outright villain a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon greenstreet is few other things on screen christmas in connecticut gave her a rare opportunity to burlesque her own image and she made the most of it in a biography of barbara stanwyck she mentions she enjoyed making christmas in connecticut as a welcome change from some villainous parts like double indemnity she d been doing recently one of the things that made doing the film so enjoyable was that between takes director peter godfrey and greenstreet would do some impromptu entertaining of cast and crew with english music hall numbers made for a relaxed and warm set and the cast responded accordingly now if only someone had been filming those numbers	1
1066	forget jimmy stewart reliving her life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead i suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and stanwyck s other great christmas story meet john doe aren t revered with the same level of love aswell you know it s name stanwyck plays a food writer for a mccall s type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes she s an ace bs artist until the day morgan s sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a navy hospital released the last year of wwii the film is dusted with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it s love at first sight unfortunately she has to play married to gardiner s prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at her farm in ct just to fool her boss sz sakall adds a great deal of hungarian malaprop & double entendre humor in support as babs  true source of culinary talent & una o connor is hilarious as gardiner s obnoxious irish housekeeper	1
1067	at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodyingtoday only some women over 50 probably remember gladys taberwhose column butternut wisdom ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970 sshe lived on stillmeadow farm in conecticutand her columns were collected into a number of booksstillmeadow seasons stillmeadow daybook etc the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys taber columnbesides cooking and country livingshe got rather nostalgic and philosophical at timesshe talked a lot about her favorite dogs mostly cocker spanielsyou might say that martha stewart is the gladys tabor of today christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiecebut it is pleasantlighthearted entertainmentsoothing to the stressed out mindand that is good enough	1
1068	from the perspective of the hectic contemporary world in which we live the so called `good old days  always seem so much more serene and innocent an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen as with `christmas in connecticut  a warm and endearing film directed by peter godfrey barbara stanwyck stars as elizabeth lane a popular `martha stewart  type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in connecticut always with the latest recipe at the center of the story one of her biggest fans is alexander yardley played by sidney greenstreet the publisher of the magazine for which she writes yardley has never visited her farm and in response to an idea expressed to her in a letter from a nurse mary joyce compton she decides to spend an old fashioned christmas with elizabeth her husband and child and as a special guest a certain mr jefferson jones dennis morgan a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after her ship was torpedoed elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss but there are problems not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high rise in the city it makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor dudley beecham robert shayne as the one thing mr yardley demands from her employees is total honesty what follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place to share a christmas past where a warm hearth good food and kindness prevail barbara stanwyck absolutely sparkles as elizabeth with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor whose trust in her fellow man is admirable even with the deceptions being played out around her she s the kind of guy you know will somehow land on her feet and in the end it s elizabeth you really feel for one of the true delights of this film however is sidney greenstreet her yardley has a gruff exterior but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as texas it s a straightforward honest portrayal and it s a joy to watch her work the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to her the supporting cast includes reginald gardiner john sloan the terrific una o connor norah frank jenks sinkewicz and dick elliott judge crothers a feel good movie that plays especially well during the christmas season though it would work any time of the year `christmas in connecticut  is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be it s a true classic and one you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10 	1
1069	i first saw this film about 15 years ago and i have been enchanted by it ever since it is such a feel good experience that i could happily watch it at any time of the year however to me it is the ultimate christmas movie the fact that it is in b&w is irrelevant   although i often wonder what it would be like in colour you can just get that warm glowing feeling watching the christmas events unfold  stanwyck and morgan are perfect together and greenstreet is the antithesis of her usual character sakall is a blustering joy to watch it is light relief and certainly does not tax the brain but leaves you feeling glad that you saw it i can t wait for it to become available on dvd in the uk i shall certainly be at the front of the queue to buy it	1
1070	this christmas gift arrived courtesy of tcm we had never seen the film even though we have seen most of the films of barbara stanwyck this comedy made us laugh so much that at times we had to restrain ourselves in order to hear the dialog this is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations especially around christmas it would certainly lift one s spirits by just letting go the movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a dvd or a vhs tape  christmas in connecticut was directed with great panache by peter godfrey based on a story by aileen hamilton  the best thing in the movie is the felicitous pairing of two of the most popular stars of that era barbara stanwyck and dennis morgan barbara stanwyck always played strong willed women obviously this was a change of pace for her in this film as well as lady eve ms stanwyck displays a knack for comedy she and mr morgan who played in a lot of musical comedies make a winning combination there are no weak performances in the film sydney greenstreet an actor notorious for playing  heavies  is a delight to watch as the rich and fat alexander yardley the man who owned a media empire and who knew a good thing when she saw it reginald gardiner an accomplished english actor adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two principals s z sakall is another source of continuous mirth she plays the hungarian chef felixwho has a hard time with her own version of the english language also una o connor makes a perfect norah the housekeeper in the sloan perfect connecticut farm in reading other comments in this forum it s sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people after all color was not widely used in the 40s and most of the classic movies have to be seen in its original format because what would be accomplished in  coloring  them this film should be a requirement for anyone looking to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at christmas time because total merriment is assured watch it with an open mind and heart an maybe you d like to see christmas in connecticut every year	1
1071	first i loved the documentary it represents a new school history theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues i ll get the camera and dogs out of the way first i hate the blair witch quality of the camera but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach in fact i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access dogs warning i have a doctoral degree in literature which i do not use as a profession so some of my training may seep in the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of human s great endeavors and our need to find the labor to achieve them the dogs might reflect their owners as one reviewer suggested but they also serve as a stand in for the workers we see in the film while this might hint at the marxist problem raised by one reviewer i think it also shows how difficult it is to globalize labor issues no mondovi s in italy may not translate as well elsewhere yikes i am a marxist at heart and hate to hear my cynical resignation hold sway it is a remarkable bait and switch the dogs are family the workers are family but in the end the dogs are the workers the last scene with the poor farmer while you may disagree with the politics the artistry of the analogy coupled with the more overt politics of the film are wonderful had only faulkner i am from alabama had the power of film beyond the hollywood market what interesting tales would have been told	1
1072	our reviewer from toronto told you what you need to know about this film except note that it needs editing the hand held technique gets really old really fast i saw this film last night in menerbes france we are in the luberon valley which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers they were all there in the salle de polyvalente for the showing crammed in polite patient genial although my french is testy i got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the old terror growers interviewed esp the one from a communist village in languedoc she got a lot of laughs this is unusual in france laughing aloud there is no question which side of the terror globalization war they are on sm	1
1073	mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one it s not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called wine except then it doesn t matter the size of your estate also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people s taste what is means many times wine filtered of it s origin mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in that of mega producer robert mondavi and michael rolland the wine expert who shapes wine to the taste of today s critics like robert parker who is also in the film now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine but they have power on a grand scale as we all know power corrupts mondovino also shows small wine makers such as aime guilbert of the languedoc and hubert de montille of volnay in burgundy these wine makers are not starving wine makers but they know like all great wine makers that it s about where the grapes are from the best example of this is explained not by a wine maker but by a haitian man working for neal rosenthal the wine importer the area the grapes are grown the terroir that matters that a guiding hand that knows this makes important real wine	1
1074	it s not really about wine no nossiter s real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local wine production for business purposes to this end she has made an excellent objective film spirited bumptious emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media finessed anodynesprech amercians and auld europeans the art of wine making against market driven laboratorised product manufacture it s an open show that doesn t lead conclusion nossiter s film is occasionally infuriating to watch   cameras are neither concealed nor steadicam by any means there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through often too short a time on screen however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can t play anyway the characters speak for   and therefore condemn   themselves well worth a viewing 7 10	1
1075	just saw this movie 2 days ago a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine i have no special interest in wine and yet i found this very enlightening the director gave me the impression that she has the ability to show people as they are while she exposes a lot of things that are below the surface she manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer she shows a lot of compassion to people and dogs and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don t want to tell the movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formula the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing but it s worth it highly recommended	1
1076	a very interesting documentary   certainly a lot more than sideways a pseudo wino drama   where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed according to the documentary   and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on parker   only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world robert parker of massachussets and michel rolland a french wine industry expert based in bordeaux and also known as a flying winemaker the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of france from sicily to argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the mondavi family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made documentray	1
1077	i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i haven t been disappointed first of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the spectator enjoy beautiful places the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular hubert de montille the shooting may be confusing the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds you may not like it but i don t consider it as a defect the themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well since globalization isn t the only issue discussed but nossiter managed to give her movie a consistency all along a great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a clich√© good against evil this could be the main difference between mondovino and michael moore s documentaries nossiter s point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by her favorite characters the richness of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of long time wine making families such as the de montilles the mondavis the antinori and the frescobaldi nossiter lets the spectator discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry this movie doesn t make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover vineyards and wine makers i watched this movie as a student in enology and let s just there are many ways to learn i give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite her technical particularities	1
1078	business vs personal conviction profit vs art as with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes this is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold if you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to equalize and standardize taste in the same way as macdonalds used to do for the fast bite something parker herself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a burger king sign it is all about image against content as another interviewee says that is the easy way the standardized way easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again controlled branded taste is easier there is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of wines to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization even across the ocean as in many other areas of today s world dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for too much standardization kills the mind and taste difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice   and not just vacuum packed more of the same standardization sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level   the lower one on this i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a hearthy sante	1
1079	i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the shorter version james mcnally s summary of the content of the film is very good nossiter very deftly blends her investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the world s dogs but also undercutting a number of interviewees  comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoked michael moore s recent work although nossiter operates in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls  the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of  salt of the earth  french peasants as the stars de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder   bravo hubert overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people and organise our world	1
1080	i saw this film at the 2004 toronto international film festival since i work in the wine business i had been quite eager to see this documentary and i wasn t disappointed reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage the good news is that nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut but a ten part ten hour series of the film on dvd by next christmas thinkfilm is distributing it the bad news is that it s still a bit of an unwieldy beast when it was shown in cannes it was close to three hours long for toronto she s cut about half an hour but it still clocked in at 135 minutes now for me that s fine i love wine and i love hearing about the controversies raging in my business but not everyone wants that much nossiter flits around the globe from brazil to france to california to italy to argentina talking to wine makers and pr people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world the theme that emerges is that globalization and the undue influence of wine critic robert parker are forcing a kind of sameness on wine small local producers are either being bought up by larger conglomerates american as well as local or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to suit the palate of mr parker who dictates taste to most of the american and world markets it s a complicated subject and i can understand why nossiter wants to let her subjects talk there is robert mondavi patriarch of the napa wine industry and her sons tim and michael whose efforts to buy land in languedoc faced opposition from local vignerons and government officials there is aim√© guibert founder and wine maker of daumas gassac iconoclastic opponent of mondavi s plans and crusader for wines that express local terror there is robert parker herself expressing some discomfort with her influence while refusing to stop writing about the wines that she favours there is flying wine maker michel rolland consultant for dozens of wineries all over the world advising them how to make parker  friendly wines there are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary if you are a wine lover you will want to seek out the ten part series as well as the theatrical version of this film but even if you re not into wine the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization are changing many of the world s oldest and most established traditions the effects on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored 8 10	1
1081	over the years i seemed to have missed this picture of ronald reagan and due to her recent passing to the big screen in heaven it was shown on tv recently this is a great low budget b&w film of the late 1930 s however it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular time frame i was surprised at the role ronald reaganeric greggthe killer s 64 played in this picture along with a great veteran film star sheila bromleynona greggnightmare circus 73 who was a great supporting actor it was a great film that showed ronald reagan as a very young man reaching for the stars in her career in hollywood at the time god bless her 	1
1082	it would seem a given but if a viewer forgets context she risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment it is easy to carp from the lofty heights of the 21st century at styles and prices of the great depression years but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word context and better understand and thus enjoy accidents will happen  among the actors ronald reagan again showed herself a good looking and personable guy and again gave a right on performance a reviewer earlier said gloria blondell played the nasty wife but that was wrong she plays the concession stand clerk who has a crush on the reagan character eric gregg but keeps hands off as long as she is married gloria was cute not as lushly beautiful as her sister joan she was still attractive and a good actress perhaps her looking somewhat like joan was a detriment to having a more successful career and it is certainly our loss sheila bromley was mrs gregg and played it well other actors included dick purcell and the great earl dwire got to play something besides a villainous cowboy again most of the players never attained the household name status many of them deserved but they by gosh gave good performances here in a story that is still current	1
1083	once again i must play something of the contrarian most of the reviews for ab tak chappan have been extremely positive mine is positive but only slightly a 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a c letter grade from me it seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors one that ab tak chappan is more realistic than the typical bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently the first point i couldn t care less about i m not looking for realism in films and so i do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how i believe the real world to be  i m a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although i do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they re realist for the second point i agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently however i don t think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself a film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent what matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer ab tak chappan is based on the true story of a mumbai cop named daya naik naik was an encounter specialist encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world judge dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they re basically given a license to kill  effectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments ab tak chappan follows the story of sadhu agashe nana patekar the encounter specialist based on naik we see her at work interacting with her fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence we see her at home trying to live a normal life in her less than luxurious surroundings we see her trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film and we see her odd relationship with a notorious indian gangster don zameer zafar prasad purandhare all of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film i agree that it s nice to forgo the typical bollywood musical numbers and romances  not every film needs that stuff ab tak chappan producer ram gopal varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that she s directed or produced additionally ab tak chappan has some good performances  patekar almost gives off a death wish 1974 era charles bronson vibe it also has admirable cinematography  the hand held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example it has a great score that mixes more of a moody hollywood sounding action crime score with traditional indian instruments and modalities the violence is well done and gritty there is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of having encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on the encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong more poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country s military and we re shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to but you just knew there was a but coming didn t you director shimit amin and her scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow all of these problems may be due to amin and crew looking at the godfather films which ab tak chappan has some at least superficial resemblances to although from a policeman s perspective most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well  these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for agashe and jatin shukla nakul vaid for one narayan i didn t know who she was until at least halfway through the film her name is mentioned a number of times but i d only get glimpses of her until the scene would change then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and i d have to start all over figuring out who narayan was the same thing happened with agashe s first commissioner the film was already far into the new commissioner before i could figure out the relationships it seems like there are new characters in every scene we never learn the stories of most of them while that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about because they re mostly doing so on orders since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it s difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn t exactly make for a gripping film the primary villain is zameer but until about halfway through the film there s no indication of this she doesn t get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and she s literally phoning her performance in  she s in another location dubai communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film we don t actually see zameer doing much to an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing zameer doing a number of things but we could see her do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out that would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half hour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact this is not an action packed film by any means for at least the first 45 minutes or so i found myself admiring ab tak chappan s considerable style but saying okay get on with the story already	1
1084	ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai india sadhu agashe is a hard working hard edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for herself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison her loyal officers obey her without question but a rift forms when one of her officers imtiaz becomes frustrated by sadhu s high ranking status and is secretly competing with her for criminal kills and status a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows her to take the lead on her first case further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india the camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds the acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director shimit amin has taken liberties with factual accounts nevertheless ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film making	1
1085	a really realistic sensible movie by ramgopal verma  no stupidity like songs as in other hindi movies class acting by nana patekar  much similarities to real  encounters 	1
1086	this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made following are the plus points of the film wonderful direction cinematography and editing the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent even though the film shows the life of mumbai policemen and their hardships it never gets boring or sympathetic mind blowing acting by lead actor nana patekar one can surely hope that she gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards controlled violence the violence is controlled and the film doesn t become a bloody mess no stupid songs as in usual indian movies 	1
1087	satya was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only she can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax as a depiction of reality it may be over dramatised but at the end of the day it s a movie so the balance is spot on i ve ordered my dvd and can t wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly non yash raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there	1
1088	no music no stupid masala a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on a real encounter specialist in india daya nayak that is ab tak 56 56 symbolises how many criminals the lead sadhu agashe has killed   well you already know that bitbrilliance exudes nan patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating indian cop the one liners are just hilarious the plot though slightly predictable on review is intriguing all the same another one of the films from ram gopal vermas the factory movies which are either decent or really good ab tak chappan meanders close to very good but yet remains one of the top 70 films released from india commercial and artsy included what is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally in an indian flick how the police network works the cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny the producers are trying for a cannes release which is interesting made by debut director shamit aman i think thats her name again 55 yo nana patekar is brilliant away from her silly shouting roles of the past just shows what a good director can do with a good actor really good stuff if you are interested in indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief again patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on her shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie  relaxed funny intelligent and calculating good dialoges good acting nice direction all in all great stuff recommendations gangaajal ram gopal verma s company both indian flicks	1
1089	i love the way she experiments ab tak chappan was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was jatin the new comer also lived up to her role and nana patekar was at her best suchak was really irritating but i think she fit the character she was playing   she had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish she signs up urmila for her other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen naach as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason don t find antra maali that exciting to watch on the screen   unlike urmila	1
1090	i almost stopped watching hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines one exception for this is ramgopal verma movies this is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast this is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories the adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional goodyou should watch this movie for nana patekar based on the life of mumbai cop daya naik this movie deals in a more realistic way the film delves into the life of the common man which she has apart from being an encounter specialist i rate this as one of the best movie of the year	1
1091	nana patekar once again proves that she is the best actor working in bombay without a doubt her recent movies involved shouting her lines that does not bode well for the theater trained thespian one wonders why she is always not given her accolades during awards season shakti the power was one of her flicks that was an utter disapointment along with kohram a missed oppurtunity to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan but patekar exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey ridding the streets of bombay of underworld dons in fake encounters patekars character takes control of the screen and the viewers attention and never lets go the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story along the same lines as the modern day cult classic company the movie is well acted directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd the final ten minutes that see nana and the main villain talk at her offshore haven are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics won t be dissapointed with this cops and robbers flick	1
1092	i still remember watching satya for the first time i was completely blown away here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen so realistic so mumbaiyya and so believable despite company which was a very good effort and vaastav more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to satya when i watched ab tak 56 for the first time i said to myself indian cops have their own  satya  now the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film what strikes you about the encounter at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine ab tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted with simple shots and camera angles director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie editing seems non existent and hence effective the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you ve left the movie hall but for me what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer if i start listing my favourite dialogues i m afraid i ll end up re writing the entire script of the movie the movie boasts of some stellar performances yashpal sharma is detestable as sub inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak revathi hrishita bhatt mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation the scene where she has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster ¬ñ oh my god she learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in her prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive her conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i ve ever seen in hindi cinema from the way she talks to her expressions from the way she taps her cigarette to the way sips her tea ¬ñ it s almost as if nana can do no wrong she is at her best in each and every scene especially when she s teaching jatin about how the police force functions her cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times her dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that she is one of the finest actors in the country it s a shame that she did not win any popular awards for this one last but in no way the least shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment i just hope that she continues the great work and doesn t give in to bollywood isation if she can do that i m sure she ll be a force to reckon with in the coming years	1
1093	it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen although not directed by ram gopal varma it has all the elements of an rgv film dead straight dialogues blunt treatment of the subject brilliant direction and superb performances even by those with little job to do in the movie the chemistry between nana and the don even if they are professional rivals is amazing and so are the small events like an insider not giving information to imtiaz even while she is being bashed up in the locker but only to nana when she is out the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully the first half keeps one absolutely engrossed moving like a documentary with nana acting like a mentor to jatin explaining to her the intricacies and philosophy of the work overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema definitely not to be missed	1
1094	one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out she had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember she has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than her supposed age of 14 any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work	1
1095	this film is amazing while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems the children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays sipho the friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make the influence of adults is interesting   it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip its of conversations and interactions much like a child would remember experiencing i would highly recommend this film	1
1096	i enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera i think it s a little bit influenced by the brazilian movie city of god but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow crime and art in social neighborhood are a reality  i think the films made by madiba are really beautiful i don t think it s unreal that she shoot such good films because there s a lot of artists that don t have any type of education and can be really genius  i enjoyed very much the soundtrack it s adjusted to the pictures see the movieit s good to show how can be a life in a social neighborhood	1
1097	yes maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn t take anything away from the film s charm and wonder it was shown as part of our town s youth film festival and was the organising committee s favourite which is not surprising the subject matter   coming together in a race torn though post apartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational of course as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats her subject matter belies these shortcomings i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children a film to watch meditate discuss and act upon	1
1098	this was a random rental at the video store but i was impressed from the start wooden camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director the film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid south africa the young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting the film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s the musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive after watching it the second time i tracked down the dvd on amazon and have been happy ever since	1
1099	this was a nice film it had a interesting storyline that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film the storyline kinda reminded me of the city of god but this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison it had what i really loveda tinge of surrealism some pretty interesting cinematography thru the wooden camera i m not sure if it was culturally correct but it definitely widens you re view of south africa the actors were good for 1st timers most of them anyway i especially liked estelle character which made this movie pretty enjoyable what is interesting though was that it makes you ask about your own life are you really doing what you really love or do you consent to the norm the conventionalism around you definitely worth a watch	1
1100	i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something else this observation has generational implications as it is coming from generation x makes comment on generation x and in the end is aimed at generation x it expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the baby boomers the parents of generation x had engendered in their marriages and family lives and which gave generation x the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed the generation x attitude to love is of course flippant but as decisions are made and commitments are broken the biggest casualty are the children of generation x this is made clear at the end of the film and was so pungent i took a week to recover from the shock i received from this epiphany	1
1101	okso by minute 15 in the film there s still no dialogue this film arrived to me in a padded sack from down under with sharpie encrypted info on the front i am a programmer from a north american fest and mod love was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem d at the far away moscow karlovy vary interface straight away i thought this film is not for us no dialogue by minute 15 but kept watching anyway well well well it built and built and built and half way in i was involved in this film because like when you go to the zoo at first you re reticent but by the time you get to the dangerous snakes bit you re totally  there  this film has a dangerousness not at all like the much hyped wolf creek but because it is so totally  other  in every way shape and form and seems to weave a web made up of all the fantasies of most independent first time helmers ie   gloomy weather red neck intrigue odd splicing eerie music and a plot which though imperfect and basic has a bit in common with one of the  great aussie movies  ie the cars that ate paris by wier but modern love is actually not really a very aussie movie in the sense of ocker ishness and playful self deprecation that pervades many of that country s films it works on a more nightmarish realm from the start no cell phones no brand names no i pods no gritty urban middle class angst   just a dude married to a good looker an old volvo and a little boy son who has weird teeth and chucks stuff around oh and it s set in weird sea side village where people all look slightly  wrong  photographed by nick matthews 237 and music by tom huzenroeder ten canoes mod luv succeeds where many aust movies fail   ie it stands up without regard to the god forsaken country that it comes out of instead it revels in a warped but entertaining riddle which the film itself cannot solve   and herein lies the weak linkwhat on earth does this film have to do with modern love the final minutes of the film seem to give an answer or at least hints at oneand as i sat and drank a coffee and ate my hershey s afterwards all that i could surmise was that this film s helmer alex frayne will prob have a lot of fun with this one 	1
1102	i saw this film via one of the actors  agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of sth australia in terms of the overall *tone* which is rightly dark and moody i thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case she was really very good in terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo well i just think this film is plain  weird  it s a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but  good  weird as opposed to  bad  its hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60 s its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it jingo my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also jingo what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious	1
1103	jingofighter i agree with some of your comments but i have to disagree on a couple of things first this film is nothing like the cars that ate paris not imho nothing like it i think the film had elements of surrealism but i think the basic approach of the film maker is not surrealist per se therefore its not really like cars paris i think more like a weird euro work with some scenes bearing the hallmark of wierd not surreal secondly i think the music by heuzenroeder is brilliant they used whistling that old sound from country and western records and its waaayyy better than most aussie films which usually team the film maker up with a dumb sounding indy band that the company wants to push as for the name of the film   i don t know why it s called modern love i was kinda hoping for david bowie to appear dressed in drag and lipstick opps i m starting to show my age	1
1104	i saw this at the bendfilm festival friday amid an unsettled crowd of people not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light whimsical short name i forget  people it was really silly to mix this short with modern love   which is a serious drama movie a film film  so the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and thenmodern love hmmmm modern love despite my reservations strange ending a little too tangentialneeded a short film that was commensurate with it s oddball strangeness so my advice to the programmers for next year is to take more care planning the show the folks watching modern love really just didn t know what had hit them   they were led up the path and this is not their fault modern love has some superb performances which play well against the tangential meanderings of the film   a film that its maker seems to have  wondered out loud  rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot too bad the audience was misinformed wrong session placement wrong short film wrong approach by the well intentioned programmers who despite good efforts need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals	1
1105	i saw this film at the 3rd adelaide international film festival at the palace cinemas and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in australian films that seem to revolve around arace bgender and c class in favour of erdare i sayjolly good cinema the producer a shy slightly eccentric chap called alex frayne introduced her film made with a bunch of her mates near the town she spent much of her childhood apparently she s spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film mostly in europe the world the film creates is both brilliant and arty not least because of strange and disconcerting editing style the gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that draws viewers into its nightmarish realm the producer returned for the q + a after wards someone asked her what her inspiration was   she replied south australia hear hear another asked her what a  day in the life of alex  entailed she replied that she drives an old ute that she has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that she s jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years and that she plays piano which helps her to think she doesn t drink booze and plays cricket once a week then the q and a session ended abruptly because of the next film screening   so my thoughts are that for the next festival they need to extend the after film sessions	1
1106	received this dvd from the accent range which is a label which specializes in art house flics they released irreversible and a range of bergman s opus the thing that struck me about alex frayne s strangely titled film modern love is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision a film that takes us into the mind of mr joe average replete with voices in the head visions and madness it s set in rural redneck australia the film doesn t trivialise or praise the folks like so many australian movies ie our films are full of loveable rogues or people with hearts of gold etc etc etc not in this film the spirit of stanley kubrick looms large here it s not flawless but has a mesmerising attention to details a romantic streak and a mood that is bracing if not embraceable minor quibblesthe transfer looks faulty   front credits were sliced they don t fit in frame also one of the short films is corrupted it stops half way	1
1107	uk born australian helmer alex frayne calls for attention with her strange necessitating a meticulous read visually stunning modern love 2006 following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology distributed by accent film australia john mark constable her wife emily victoria hill and their son edward william traeger arrive in a small southern town to take care of her deceased uncle s don barker property while emily and edward check into a local hotel john begins to question the locals about uncle tom s death   some say that she committed suicide some are unwilling to talk puzzled john comes up with a theory of her own   uncle tom is alive and well hiding in the nearby bushes if not for the occasional lines of dialog used to ease its heavy atmospheric tone modern love could have been easily mistaken for a sokurov film shot with a 16mm camera its washed out color scheme is strangely evocative of the russian director s reflective forays into human agony perhaps it isn t a coincidence that it was at the moscow international film festival where modern love had its premiere looking under the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals however reveals a slightly different picture   while sokurov s films tend to remain painfully intimate to a point where they intentionally detach the main protagonists from the surrounding environment by blurring everything into a large splash of the director s preferred yellow modern love very much feeds off the australian countryside john s gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses the more it becomes obvious that nature was an integral part of frayne s vision in sokurov s the second circle a young man returns to the russian countryside to bury her deceased father in the shack where the old man once lived everything is covered with dust she gathers the few old clothes scattered around and places the body of her father in a coffin then she bids goodbye and buries it the rest of the film is a prolonged reflection on the collapse of the soviet system the loneliness and dissatisfaction many were left dealing with in modern love somewhat ironically love is nowhere to be seen on the contrary it is pain loneliness and dissatisfaction with modernity that suddenly invade john s life unlike the second circle however here the main protagonist has the opportunity to re embrace her modern life her wife and son await her yet she walks away slowly but surely the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past i doubt frayne intended for modern love to be so strikingly similar to what sokurov did in the second circle yet the pacing and in particular the puzzling framing are precisely what transforms this film into a near meditative experience   a difficult and enormously brittle approach to deconstructing human psychology the two directors have mastered to perfection mark constable delivers a top notch performance as john adding even greater depth to her highly challenging character her facial expressions are outstanding both victoria hill and william traeger match perfectly with their performances pic s tense visual style	1
1108	ok a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian be careful about who you see this film with   ie   do not take kids to see this film i ll explain why 1   the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance   i assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2   the film itself is really very very disturbing i have some problems   first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a  horror film  but it is a very disturbing film and involves a child and her parents and a small town ok it boils down to this the film is not suitable for minors because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child is has a bizarre quality to it and its only because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable as a parent myself i feel strongly enough to want to tell people because i read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres i hope im not offending the film makers by saying this but i think its my right because its getting a release and has an m rating onlybecause its not violent or sexual just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself	1
1109	i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival which as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema  i have been keen on australian film for a number of years so was pleased to learn that this film was included and i was certainly not disappointed  superbly shot firmly directed it s an eerie tale of one man and her journey to the heart of darkness as it were it reminded me a tad of lynch s wild at heart it has that strange madness in it but i was glued to the movie for other reasons   namely that it presents a portrait of australia which iswell very believable i have vacationed to the land down under a number of times once in the 1980 s and again about 7 years ago with my wife  i don t wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia a country that is responsible for the extremities of say nick cave on one hand and steve irwin the  crocodile hunter  on the other one incy wincy whinge     i would have preferred even more of the  unknown  australia much more in fact but i also realise that there s only 1 and a half hours to do it all in  sigh  overall though this movie is very very accomplished	1
1110	this film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching modern love worked well in the gold coast film fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an australian cinema that is usually neglected most importantly it is refreshing to see australian cinema not taking on the clich√© aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years this film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings the performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic an interesting exploration into family relationships and environments	1
1111	john and her wife emily accompanied by their child edward venture from the comfortable environs of suburbia to the village where the husband spent some of her childhood there has been a death in the family and john must begin proceedings to take control of an old ramshackle cottage situated by the seaside and once inhabited by an old man who has apparently committed suicide sceptical about the circumstances of the death john divorces herself from her family and from reality puts her own life in peril and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead the film now changes   nothing is what it seems   the people of her past appear in full gothic hillbilly glory   her wife worries about her mental state   and her son disappears into the reeds john finds that the old man didn t commit suicide that her death is far more mysterious and strange in a spine chilling finale we learn that the events of the film actually never happened and that the entire narrative was imagined by the little boy edward who is struggling to come to terms with her parents  divorce proceedings modern love is a macabre piece of high art cinema a puzzling and perverse piece of pretentiousness full of vague suggestion and unexplored red herrings it is humourless and seemingly unconcerned with current indie trends which both validates its creators but also renders it pass√© but the weaknesses of this australian film are fully outweighed by its sheer muscular cinematic vision its bloody minded and uncompromising precision and its oddball euro horror the bastardry of script norms and lack of slick dialogue pales into insignificance against a backdrop of noir and a lead performance that needs to be seen to be appreciated one of the most aggressively weird australian films in years	1
1112	we see a man move from city to out back and change dramatically   her family asks questions but she goes mad strange brilliant film for screening here in israel wonderful locations great actors a film which masquerades as a thriller but which is more a case study of madness in the lead man the film was way above the other films screened as part of the aice festival here in israel best of luck to the team who arrived at this film it s a grand guignol a little masterpiece of noir my only criticism which prevents a 10 is that the sound and the music is overpowering at times it tends to get in the way of the images which speak for themselves	1
1113	the most vivid portrait of small town oddity i ve seen in a long time  and i m not just talking about australian films this piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really it s an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent aust film making at times it is rather slow and strange   it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it s a thriller or a  head movie  but the stunning aspect of the film by alex frayne is its iron fisted ruthless direction it never wavers it is highly controlled precise and absolutely self assured the cinematography is some of the most artful beautiful and lyrical i ve seen the sound is all psychological the music builds the tension by the third act the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge   don t attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes it s a bit of an impost   but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance a sort of hypnosis and you ve been sold a riddle   that has no real answer	1
1114	talking about competition features at the split film festival we have titles from all over the world china korea canada usa and australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears modern lovethats for sure  in that movie by alex frayne two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man s uncle who raised her a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances the coastal village seems like something in an american horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants but episodes in alex frayne s pastorella can t be described as horror in the normal way in fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more in this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric australian film making thus is the the case of frayne always something new and fresh visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some australian directors is astonishing good frayne s movie is super there is something in the australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in frayne s modern love and in ray lawrence movies lantana and jindabyne it seems it will be the same in future titles of alex frayne	1
1115	i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour   i was a little drunk and tired i went to bed and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep i couldn t stop thinking about why so i got up switched the tv back on loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie well done alex frayne sir you ve managed to implant your film into this old cynical movie goers head and that takes doing so 10 out of 10 to you i can t say i  love  this film of yours but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc	1
1116	this is a great family film dealing with down to earth people who enjoy their local interests dealing mainly with horse racing lloyd bourdelle walter matthau is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named casey bourdelle who loves horses lloyd is able to raise a full grown horse who she calls casey s shadow after her son and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race sarah blue  alexis smith becomes interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for $50000 dollars however this horse receives serious injuries to her legs and lloyd receives a serious set back which upsets the entire family walter matthau gave an outstanding performance and this is a great film to view and enjoy	1
1117	a wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie 75+ %entertainment casey buddy kelly marsh are very interesting and lovable characters the horses are real beauties has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons the very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to andrew rubin puts in a wonderful performance as buddythe sensible elder brother somewhat reminded me of aidan quinneyes speech delivery facial appearance  casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness sarah blue is also nicely portrayed by alexis smith lloyd bourdelle the father is played by walter matthau and she is the character though there is room for improvement in the movie its a very enjoyable feel good movie	1
1118	walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it she turns in a very realistic performance as a small time horse trainer and single father not sugar coating either role she can be by turns soft hearted and doting then iron handed to her boys and we can see the same dichotomy in her approach to horse training we see that she doesn t want her young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small time races but she seems to be willing to risk the horse s life when she gets into the big time this is just one of matthau s wonderful performances and one that i highly recommend	1
1119	a good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others it s a horse racing movie and it s a little man gets her chance movie and it s a how far would you go movie walter mattau once again proves her adaptability as an actor she fits right in as lloyd bourdelle a louisiana cajun horse bum this movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of lousiana cajun horse drag racing she has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect had nothing but a filling station and a good horse the bourdelles seize the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse shadow to ruidoso new mexico to get ready to run in the all american futurity but how far will lloyd go to win the fame and fortune also memorable from this movie are scenes of lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for her truck to start	1
1120	one of my favorite movies i like horses i like happy endings and i like walter matthau i miss her and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why she was so wonderful watch it with your kids or your horse the story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids and down on her luck if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline it may be a little below seabiscuit but not a lot the story is the same one except it is the quarter horse version well acted correct racing terms and equipment and nice racing scenes don t take my word for it get it and make up your own mind	1
1121	another of the endless amount of cookie cutter  kickboxers fight to the death for the amusement of wealthy scumbags  films that there were so many of in the 90s y know the ones created by taking the words  death   blood  and  steel  and the words  ring   fight   match  and  cage  and putting them in a random generator saying that though death match is a pretty good entry in the over used genre thanks to its exciting fight scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast the story concerns two buddies   ex kickboxing world champion john larson played by pug faced middleweight kickboxing champ ian jacklin probably previously best known for her awful performance as the main villain in ring of fire 2 and nick wallace nick hill a likable guy probably best known for the role of street fighter sergio in bloodsport 2 who work the la docks loading crates onto ships one discovery of a boxful of guns and a brief fight later our two heroes are jobless and propping up an la bar sensible john larson decides to head north and look for a job headstrong nick wallace has heard of a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches why should things change says john  if you need me i ll be there predictably enough it isn t long before nick has gone missing and her good friend is fighting in the deadly  ring of death  trying to find a lead to her missing buddy sure enough there are no prizes for originality here but like i said before this films strength lies in its action its cast of real life fighters and the fairly good performances it manages to wring from them ian jacklin in particular surprised me previously i d just seen her as the bad guy in ring of fire 2 and in bit parts in tripe like the steel ring and i ve always been quite amused at how bad an actor she is good fighter though but in death match she s pretty good given a decent script and a haircut she proves herself to be quite the charismatic leading man and her friendship with nick is very well portrayed jacklin and hill have a nice chemistry and you really believe these two characters care for each other enough for one of them to lose a job travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other   i wish i had a friend like that  it was also nice to see matthias hues as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we re used to seeing from her many  villainous henchman  roles however don t be fooled into thinking she s the star just because she s on the video cover with it seems her head stuck on the body of michael bernardo from the cover of shootfighter   she is good while she s on screen but she isn t on much on the negative side the film is pretty slow when there s no fighting going on with lots of unnecessary scenes whats with gangster jimmie fiorello s pointless story about her grandfather and the end fight is disappointingly short but on the whole i enjoyed it plenty of fights most of them good isn t that all we martial arts really need and of course eye candy here in the lovely form of the very pretty renee ammann all in all a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie	1
1122	this is a decent effort for a b movie martial arts actioner ian jacklin a former north american cruiser weight kickboxing champion is the lead and acquits herself well in the action scenes the muscular matthias hues gets a chance to add more to her martial arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of her many others and if you are a fan of the teutonic titan rent this movie now renee griffin is also noteworthy as the romantic interest in this film she starts off with attitude but soon warms up to the hero and they make the beast with two backs in a very stylish fashion the fight scenes are good in the american tradition no hong kong acrobatics here with added realism from having benny the jet urquidez playing herself as john larson s jacklin trainer all in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre so you get more of a story	1
1123	this show is absolutely fantastic it provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows like the oc and dawsons but it s a whole lot funnier it s a show with morals and values without everything being sugar coated and sanitised ala 7th heaven we don t have sororities or fraternities in australia and our university system is completely different so i have no idea how accurately greek life is portrayed but i don t care because this show is my new favourite any writer that can make me love a racist homophobe confederate flag waving bible basher must be genius and cappie is my new pacey sorry josh jackson you ve been dethroned	1
1124	as someone who was in a pan hellenic sorority i wasn t sure what to expect when i tuned into this show after seeing so many over dramatizations in made for tv movies and the craziness of the reality shows i was curious to see if greek would be able to show the true college and greek life experience i was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever familiar characters of this genre but it was also able to add depth to the characters greek life isn t just about parties and petty conflict although those things happen within greek life they also happen in any other social or professional circle throughout a person s life to characterize it as some exclusive experience to those in a greek organization would be false most of the story lines and situations taking place in greek can and do take place everywhere in every circle of friends on sports teams in real life but i ve watched both episodes and my little sister whom i m still very close to and i have spent both episodes laughing and being reminded of how they ve truly captured the spirit of our college years and experiences i liked how the second episode showed how the characters struggle with the other facets of their lives school relationships goals etc cappie telling rusty that school comes first and going to your brothers for help that was very true to life you can t stay in an organization if you have bad grades the way rusty got her assignment to her professor was far fetched but it was entertaining even the dynamic between casey and rusty it happens you grow up and whatever your relationship with your siblings was it changes so you must adjust the bottom line greek is a great show great entertainment value and enough real life in there to be believable and definitely worth the viewers time	1
1125	i am so excited that greek is back this season looks really eventful im glad that casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they re highlighting her  scheming talent  i loved calvin s new haircut it makes her look more mature they should shave cappy s head as well all the guys are hot but calvin is definitely the hottest i cant wait to see more of her i m especially interested in what happens between calvin adam & rusty i also love rebecca she s really pretty i actually think that rebecca & calvin should hook up go for it calvin join my team	1
1126	i cannot believe i was hooked on this show instantly after seeing the first scene i was in it deep  anyway first of all the guys are hot cappy evan calvin fischer cappy heath cappy etc secondly the girls are cute sexy smart and are not afraid of being called bitches i like that which at the same time doesn t make them mean and greedy just realistic third the relationships are so great especially casey and cappy lately every show turns very away from it s original path and people end up with someone who wasn t even in the first season cappy and casey s relationship is true love a kind that lasts they loved each other throughout the years and it didn t end when a guest star appeared  in todays world maybe it s kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens and people define each other in college so i knew exactly who i wanted to be with in college just like casey and cappy  i hope there are many more seasons of this show and i hope we can see the relationship between casey and cappy now that they will probably stay together at thanksgiving love this show	1
1127	i love this show i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see s casey her sister to now where she s dating dana love this show cant wait until monday night also i am so glad that cappie and casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy as for evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale i just looked it up about the main part of the cast and i am so shocked that casey cartwrightspencer grammaris kelsey grammar s daughter that just surprises me so much and the other thing that s a huge shocker is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother birth date with my year and i had been watching her the whole entire time and had no clue	1
1128	when i sat down to watch greek for the first time i wasn t expecting a show with complex characters intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing but that s exactly what i got greek follows several college students who are in the greek system at cyprus rhodes university rusty cartwright enters cyprus rhodes as a polymer science major who aspires to be in a fraternity her older sister casey the show s center and soon to be president of zeta beta zeta the most prestigious sorority on campus isn t exactly supportive of her plans in fact none of her friends even knew she had a brother until she set foot on the college grounds on top of dealing with the fact that her dorky younger brother has been forced back into her life casey s boyfriend evan chambers soon to be president of the fraternity on campus omega chi is cheating on her with a new zbz pledge rebecca logan diabolical zbz president frannie is pressuring her to stay with her and she still has feelings for her slacker ex boyfriend cappie president of the party house on campus kappa tau these characters are joined by calvin owens an athletic intelligent friend of rusty s who happens to be gay dale kettlewell rusty s die hard christian and possibly racist roommate and best friend and ashleigh casey s quirky best friend and confidante throughout greek s two seasons or four chapters viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white but in shades of gray from here on out every character makes their fair share of mistakes but every one of them has redeemable qualities casey and cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series rusty dale and calvin s friendship is not always perfect but they manage to survive every obstacle that is thrown at them even frannie rebecca and evan the show s villains are shown as human every once in a while greek shows college students at their best worst and in between it is a show that reveals college as what it truly is a four year adventure where one s morals beliefs and willpower are tested compromised and sometimes even changed greek has at least one season left if not more before it ends i cannot wait to see where the characters end up next greek is not your typical abc family sitcom if you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation greek is the show for you	1
1129	i have watched two episodes so far i really like it even though i am no longer in college it makes me miss the wonderful college life i wish that i spent a little more time socializing i kind of identify myself with rusty when i was rushing a fraternity my big brother was not like cappie at all i wish that i had a big brother like her so if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters then it is a pretty good show it is more realistic than american pie with less explicit sex jokes can we also call this a younger version of desperate wives some of the writers must be greeks themselves the story seems to reflect somewhat of the real fraternity and sorority life it was shot in high definition and they actually filmed outside instead of inside of studios so the picture quality is very good they could easily make this a good film unlike a movie which can only last a few hours i can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it free on tv weekly the casting is excellent the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh so that makes them more real this show practically is about everyone there are asian and black frat boys and sorority girls in the show as well it is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the fraternity had sex in first episode then tried to hook up again in the second episode i don t think that i have seen anything like this on tv before this show somehow reminded me about a warner bro s tv show of teenagers called young americans which got canceled in early 2001 in that show a girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy and that guy thought that she was a male homosexual greek life can be fun but on the same time students have to study for exams etc by the time when people actually have some free time in their lives there is no fraternity of sorority for them to join any more i don t know how long this show will last sooner or later those people will have to graduate college too maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life	1
1130	i watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations having just graduated college and moved on to real life i was not in a fraternity but a lot of my best buddies were and i got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house so i know what goes on to some extent this show is obviously a dramatization not a documentary in any way of greek life or college life for that matter although it does hold a lot of truth albeit exaggerated for the most part if you watch the show for the value it contains as a tv show and nothing more it is very entertaining much like movies such as old school porky s animal house etc if you watch it expecting it to chronicle all of your experiences in your own college life you will probably either be left wanting more or mad that they over dramatize a lot of events	1
1131	i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid since i am part of a sorority i didn t want them to make greek organizations look bad but i think greek is hilarious yes they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it s not mocking but just cute humor all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan i just can t stand her casey and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister then there is cappie who doesn t love a guy like cappie haha her character brings so much to the show rusty s room mate dale played by clark duke is hilarious as well it s definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2 i can t wait till it is back on	1
1132	i m not a big tv person but when i saw the premier episode of greek i couldn t wait until next week i don t miss the show for nothing thank god for dvr lol i m in love with cappie she acts like a bad boy but she is so sweet everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby persons i didn t go to school in usa so i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show i didn t pay attention until she asked me to watch it and since i didn t have noting better to do i agreed i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it so i m with the other people that voted for this show to continue on i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining	1
1133	i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007 and thought it would be short lived and not very well written because it was on abc family never doubt an abc family show this show surprised me in the best way possible not only is the show well written story lines are realistic funny and enjoyable i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships something like this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid etc but this show is anything but the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all there is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes don t doubt this show it is truly enjoyable to watch and get hooked on 	1
1134	so when i first saw commercials for greek i did have a few questions to how they were going to approach greek life if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings or what most college kids think of greek life as a huge party luckily it covered everything the story plot was great it gave you a character to love hate someone you want to be like someone you don t want to be like and of course a crazy roommate it was one of my first looks at what writers believed greek life to be like and i can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on i love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between rusty and her crazy roommate its hard enough moving away from home and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don t even know then come to find out you have nothing in common probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmare rustys sister casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of what didn t she have oh thats right evan all to herself rebecca and evan had an affair early into the season which made you feel fairly sympathetic for casey her character evolved and her relationship with rusty became more and more loving and outgoing  cappie is one of the most fun loving characters and absolutely insane one of my favorite episodes included her getting completely trashed at a strip club and rusty having to call casey to bail them out i like how they addressed the issue of gay people in greek houses calvin was a very real feeling character and i really respected her because she stuck to her standards so jen k was fairly crazy but she actually liked rusty it was surprising and i continued to question her from the start but of course i did want it to work out between her and rusty i am definitely looking forward to the return of greek it takes you into the truth of greek life something that a lot of people look past one of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking greek is a great show and the characters are easy to relate to	1
1135	i really like the show as a part of greek life i can say that some things are over exaggerated but overall it s still pretty damn funny rusty is a likable lead character her roommate is hilarious and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights i like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations this show covers it all and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad how else could it be on abc family my favorites are cappie of course rusty s roommate and pretty much all of kappa tau this show is a great launch pad for them and i m excited to see what doors this opens  please renew this show next summer abc family like i said love love love it	1
1136	when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc family s so bad they re almost good shows but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene harkened to an only slightly dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there this isn t a show for over sensitive greeks if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren t so great about greek life then you ll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it it s nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is	1
1137	i saw this movie once a long time ago just once and i didn t know where it had come from and i looked for about six years to find it and i finally found it here at imdbcom just the whole concept of the movie is great i believe it s got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings keeping tabs on us and our planet but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity and the way that she does itto keep herself from being tracked and located is what keeps the movie entertaining i don t remember exactly how it ended but i remember it finished with a great climax and a good twist	1
1138	ten years before the matrix and hot on the heals of they live came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making if you like bizarre unconventional intellectually challenging david lynch meets john carpenter style movie making you ll love split there are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards the plot involves a man named starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream similar to they live 1984 and the matrix it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy big brother type government agents that know everything about us and have invisible robot probes constantly patrolling the city this is all revealed pretty early on in the plot possible spoiler starker has invented a drug that when placed in the water supply will wake everyone up from the illusion of reality along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways the director makes do with her shoestring budget the other highlights of this film are the monologues i challenge anyone to not be rewinding memorizing and quoting the classic quotes from this movie for years to come	1
1139	if you listen to ween the pod god satan then you know what s going on with split i found that watching the film under the influence of lsd helped to deal with audio video tracers from fantastic editing job the plot was only important from second to second the acid helped to interact with the sounds subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece don t bother writing about something out of your comprehension s reachthere just isn t enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it s most raw  amateur level i dare anyone to make a movie that can equally mess with my head and change the way i look at visual arts and the world s reality not to mention the many realities that haven t yet been explored by this humans mind i love the vision of chris shaw i also appreciate the texturing terroristic film the begotten by e elias merhige	1
1140	this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence { just like curse of frankenstein from 1957}  if you don t like odd non mainstream films steer clear of this masterpiece for me the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today for being produced in the 1980s this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and monitor us there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes { thats why i ve watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all it may prove to be well worth your time the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism  they are only concerned about accumulating and procreating the hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been  tagged and monitored by big brother her mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity yes its very low budget but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating if you have an open mind this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling	1
1141	i went to this film having no idea what to expect i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non mainstream movies it s not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone the original plot is very easy to follow there s a lot of subtle humor here s a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost a big brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society suddenly a new person appears and there s no data on her she appears insane she may or may not be the second coming of christ the over cautious government goes into a frenzy to find her and discover her true motives the ruler is also obsessed with immortality some scenes are frantic while others are completely low key we follow the lead character as she encounters all different kinds of people in society i didn t need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film but i know that some of my friends felt that helped split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco	1
1142	in a very near future world a corrupt government monitors everyone constantly with computers and surveillance one man has managed to evade assimilation and operates outside the system fighting to preserve her freedom an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work there are some confusing and slow parts but all in all an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget	1
1143	i agree with msinabottle this is a great movie here are some dialogue snippets raisuli sean connery to eden pedecaris candice bergen you see the man at the well how she draws the water when one bucket empties the other fills it is so with the world at present you are full of power but you re spilling it wastefully and islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket  raisuli the english have paid very well in the past pedecaris well you ll not have your way with the americans president roosevelt will have your head for this raisuli roosevelt this president roosevelt  she would try and take it herself pedecaris she certainly would she is a man of grit and strong moral fiber she does not kidnap women and children raisuli what kind of rifle does she use pedecaris a winchester raisuli winchester winchester i have no knowledge of this rifle pedecaris you will  teddy roosevelt brian keith the american grizzly bear is a symbol of the american character strength intelligence ferocity a little blind and reckless at times but courageous beyond all doubt oh and one other trait goes with all previous newspaper reporter and that mr president teddy roosevelt loneliness the bear lives out her life alone indomitable unconquered but always alone she has no real allies only enemies  but none of them are as great as she newspaper reporter you feel this might be an american trait teddy roosevelt certainly the world would never love us it may respect us it may even grow to fear us but it ll never love us for we have too much audacity and we re a bit blind and reckless at times too	1
1144	i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it based on a true story this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film seriously i couldn t find anything wrong with it one definite plus is how it was filmed set in morrocco in 1904 the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great raisuli on horseback especially the cinematography was faultless the editing was crisp the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking and i have to mention the music from jerry goldsmith it was phenomenal i have used this phrase a lot recently but goldsmith ain t my favourite film composer for nothing her score here is so rousing and exciting it shows the man s true musical genius and this gem of a score should be up there with goldsmith s best scores with legend rambofirst blood patton and the secret of nimh the action is exhilarating and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated the direction is sensitively handled too the performances were astounding as well with sean connery ever the picture of charisma and suavity magnificent as the great raisuli she almost dominates the entire picture on her own she is joined by a feisty candice bergen a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of her more understated performances the history is fairly accurate perhaps flimsy in some areas but with the acting music and visuals so good i am past caring 10 10 bethany cox	1
1145	the wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture it is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more connery despite the thick scottish brogue plays the raisulu very well she inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot  candice bergen in one of her early roles is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite mrs pedacaris showing courage in the face of adversity and plenty of humour as well a marvelous film rent or buy it and you won t be disappointed	1
1146	the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted it is a tale that exemplifies the american spirit and the american character this movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely relevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century it is a true classic	1
1147	the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on the action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content the uniforms and weaponry of both the us and german troops were perfect the costumes and weaponry of the berbers were perfectly accurate as well this film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the usmc academy for this purpose the scenes depicting roosevelt shooting and the rifles she was using was beautiful procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for millius is a genius	1
1148	 average adventure movie that took a serious story and holywoodised itthe watering down effect done particularly towards the average script snatched away this movie s place as a would be solid classic why water down such a great storylineprobably because it deals with sensitive colonial subject matters and the producers do not want to create political heatjust quick profits thank youthe directingcinematography and soundtrack and acting was goodthe screenplay was averagethe charm of connery made up for her wrong arabic accent and all the scenes with president t roosevelt were masterpiece takesthe costumes sets here was very goodtoo bad we did not get more of a serious historical drama since this is what the story demandsonly for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure holywood movies	1
1149	in a morocco completely invaded by europeans and americans in the beginning of the twentieth century the moroccan leader mulay achmed mohammed el raisuli the magnificent sean connery kidnaps the american eden pedecaris candice bergen her son and her daughter her intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them to fight against the corrupt sultan of moroco marc zuber in times of election the american president theodore roosevelt brian keith agrees with the proposal however raisuli is betrayed and eden helps her to be released from the prison with the american soldiers i do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries but `the lion and the wind  is indeed a great adventure the action scenes are very realistic candice bergen the most beautiful american actress in the 70¬¥s is wonderful performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `soldier blue  sean connery is perfect as usual as an honest and nationalist religious leader brian keith is great as the american president i do not know much about the morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment in brazil it is only available on vhs my vote is eight title brazil `o vento e o le√£o  `the lion and the wind  	1
1150	i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is just the memory of this movie right now enchants me if you want to see a sweeping epic of a movie with wonderful actors in vivid scenery with great dialogue reminding you of what early america could have been like what the world could have been like back thenwelli highly recommend this movie especially during a time of war and conflict in iraqwhen our american image is not at all what it used to bethis movie takes you back to a time when we were just starting out when being an american meant really picking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going when the world was such an untamed and unknown place well this movie has thatand more enjoy	1
1151	got back from morocco then where my dad was attached to the german embassy when the film came out in europe took all my girlfriends to see it show them the beauty of the country where jimi had played   and stayed   where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now the stones went there earlier brian recorded in tangiers  so it s memories and family entertainment and i m glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie candice bergen looks beautiful and oo7 connery is pretty funny indeed and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive	1
1152	now lissen you guys i loved this film though not quite as much as farewell to the king another beloved john milius epic it was fun a lot more than if it were based on a tennessee williams drama it s a great yarn with a whiff of political correctness i love this film for its beautiful photography its humor and its attenuated criticism of the bad guys berbers and the real bad guys the spear  carriers for the acquisitive  civilized  world with their repeating rifles artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor  the standout scene is the berber encampment with blue gray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air it is visually eloquent highly evocative set in 1904 morocco wind features a helpless american woman candace bergen who is taken hostage by a dashing albeit immodest berber bandit sean connery the very model ofa scottish muslim nomad the exciting story is based on a few historical facts the photography is milius beautiful punctuated by jerry goldsmith s outstanding score mrs pedicaris and the raisuli conduct protracted foreplay and bounce around in the desert between oases even though the raisuli proudly traces her lineage back to the apes she is a perfect gentleman   she even lets her keep her head after she beats her at chess a marine detachment storms the bashaw s palace putting out the fires of competing hegemonies with gasoline don t mess with the corps abdul  there are many entertaining stereotypes despicable sultan   resembles a dissipated ferret definitely not a liberal cruel german officer   a large bellicose dachshund sporting a monocle she gallantly chooses to fight the raisuli with swords instead of gunning her down in the manner of indiana jones noblesse oblige by way of von clausewitz dashing marine officer   kicks the crap out of the bashaw of tangier s army and storms her palace while chewing tobacco her speech is mildly aphasic the bashaw begged her not to breathe on her the berbers   a horde of groveling sycophants led by a charming megalomaniac none of them take baths except perhaps in camel urine president teddy roosevelt is undeservedly portrayed as vacuous and preoccupied with guns toys and stuffed grizzly bears beautiful american widow   gives the men a lesson in courage as do her two children she evidently has a huge supply of clean starched clothes and rarely has a hair out of place  the raisuli sends teddy roosevelt a message thanking her for the gift of a remington repeating rifle declaring meester roosevelt you are the lion and aiee am the breaking wind how true please do not take my acerbic remarks to mean that i did not like the film i had almost as much fun writing this as watching da pitcher	1
1153	one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure holywood movies as if those weren t reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connery s accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn t love movies see it and be awed by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make  em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10	1
1154	okayi m a history buffand okayi m a action film junkieso of coursethis film is on my top ten of all timei really love the action scenesand the unique weaponry of the periodi sort of have doubts about fighting two handed sword from horse backand the raisuli sword seems more katana like than scimitar likeoh welli ve never fought from horse backeither i love the attempts at philosophic proverbstoothe typical desert tribesman probably couldn t read the koranso they d take her word for itseveral writers have criticized connery s broguewellon vacation as a youthi met a family of south africans in our westdinosaur national monumentand although they spoke africaans between themselvesyeahsecond generation germans can hear the differencethey spoke english with a scottish brogueseems that who teaches you affects your pronunciationscottish missionary	1
1155	taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident the wind and the lion is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of africa el raisuli sean connery head of an arab tribe kidnaps an american womancandice bergen and her two children to obtain some concessions for her country out of american president theodore roosevelt brian keith out of this simple plot john milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre the outdoor dessert locations an impressive color photography very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness the musical score is also remarkable an fits accordingly sean connery is very good as the arab leader and proofs she can handle almost any kind of role so is candice bergen as the woman who shows strength under dangerous circumstances but deep inside is scared and has her weaknesses she gets to admire connery and even understand her complete different focus on life arising from their also completely different cultures brian keith plays one of her best roles ever as american president teddy roosevelt most entertaining and very good cinematographic sample in the genre give it chance you won t regret it	1
1156	1904 the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto a tenuous independence as the various european powers   france germany britain russia spain and now the united states   are vying for influence in the region the sultan marc zuber is a weak puppet her uncle the bashaw vladek sheybal who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter berber chieftan raisuli sean connery the leader of the rif tribe and the last of the barbary pirates who kidnaps an american missionary eden pedecaris candice bergen and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore roosevelt brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue pedecaris alive or raisuli dead   seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise her big stick diplomacy though secretary of state john hay john huston is not so confident however the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event john milius s great historical film based very loosely off of a true story ie pedecaris was a middle aged man is a wonderful bit of escapism it has some amazing action scenes a witty well written script a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say pirates of the caribbean or the lord of the rings movies it s not really an epic film in the strictest sense but it s one of the best pure action movies ever made while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made as president roosevelt says america is like a grizzly bear   fierce strong but a little blind and reckless at times at the time of the film s setting america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the spanish american war   and roosevelt seizes this incident as a way to prove america s worth in real life it didn t quite work out that way but allegorically it works well while written from a right wing perspective milius s screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world she admires roosevelt and her method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of roosevelt that while america may be feared and respected they ll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes   like roosevelt s target shooting of european leaders and the almost comic surprise attack by marines on the bashaw s palace   which show america s reckless and violent side while others   the climactic showdown with the germans   show their heroism the historical political context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially a rousing action adventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as raisuli s rescue of the pedecaris s from double crossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of arabia and the wild bunch while a major historical fantasy a three way battle between germans americans and the rifs is a superbly staged adrenaline pumping sequence the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having a fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as a berber with a scottish accent but manages to pull off her interesting well drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect her hostage and abhors modern uncivil warfare candice bergen an actress whom i ve never been fond of gives a fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris who is every bit as tough as her captor brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr   you really feel she must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history   and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality john huston provides solid support as the weary cautious hay acting as a perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt  among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve kanaly as the gung ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal nadim sawalha roy jenson larry cross marc zuber and darrell fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint john a fistful of dynamite as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisuli s tribesmen the wind and the lion is all around a wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun  and swordplay a lot of humor a tough feisty heroine and her two cute children a nice if unconsummated romance and an interesting if fanciful political historical context it s not a masterpiece but hey it wasn t trying to be i give the wind and the lion a stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation	1
1157	why couldn t the end of the movie have been sean connery s men fighting the french instead of the germans ever since the french had occupied algeria in 1830 the tribes from morocco and those of algeria were making raids on the french military and civilian settlements this movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the french had seize the rasuadli so her followers would not be raiding algeria and then her followers would have attacked the french to free her the movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the germans and the americans when the americans shoot the germans their guns even the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their enemies are screaming after being shot when germans shoot at the americans their guns don t make large sounds do not create bloody wounds and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot in real life the american krag rifle was the worst rifle america had ever produce until the early version of the m 16 came along the krag was hard to maintain not reliable and the rifle bolt was always jamming the german mauser was one of the world s finest rifles we were so impress by it during spanish american war that we made a copy of it and call it the springfield rifle finally the people of morocco must had a word for artillery since the french were using them in their raids against morocco i didn t like it when they made the rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the moorican vocabulary instead the rasuadli stated that the europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake	1
1158	this is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch with a great cast and a good story based on true events it s interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events it s above all for most part an adventurous story with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an arabic world so lots of sword fighting good old fashioned honor religion and a rich proud country but the movie is also filled with humor to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch the constant cutting back and forth between the morocco plot involving sean connery and candice berger and the american plot line involving theodore roosevelt brian keith wasn t the best possible approach in my opinion the two things have totally different paces totally different characters it are just totally different worlds of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out it doesn t at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed the american plot line is most of the time more political while the morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled in the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or roosevelt in this movie was seem that john milius is just a big admirer of her often the american plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced morrocan plot line after all john milius always has been at her best as an action director it isn t until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam the most  and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint i wish the entire movie was like this that way this movie would had also been a better known one no doubt the movie has a great jerry goldsmith musical score that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself the movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it appereantly the movie only costs $4000000 to make but that is really hard to believe considering the settings and size of the movie i mean john milius her best known movie conan the barbarian cost about $20000000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale quite funny to see an arabic speak with a big fat scottish accent but hey it s sean connery so you just simply tend to accept this she suits her role well so does candice bergen it s always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages also john huston plays a great role in this movie a perfectly fine watchable movie 7 10	1
1159	writer director john milius takes a little known incident from american history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways the result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable larger than life roles sean connery as the wily arab sheik with an inexplicable scottish brogue and brian keith as president theodore roosevelt itching for the chance to put that big stick to good use aided immeasurably by billy williams  glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable jerry goldsmith this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries lucas coppola and spielberg although milius served up tantalizing glimpses of her ability in scripts for jeremiah johnson and apocalypse now her career seemed to take a downward turn not long after she started directing ultimately foundering on dreck like conan the barbarian and red dawn  here s hoping that she will again find her way	1
1160	this is one great sweeping movie you will remember for a long time it is about history america the change of times teddy roosevelt morocco a kidnapped american and her children and the leader of the berbers with the blood of the prophet in her veins this movie is based on a true story  like jesse james was a banker an american was kidnapped in morocco and the marines went part way to the shores of tripoli to rescue her so much for that you know hollywood sean connery is the berber chieftain and muslim leader candice bergan is the guy who was kidnapped along with her two kids the son is rex harrison s grandson simon no less john huston is secretary of state with a great john huston style straight line at a state dinner watch out for it brian kieth is teddy roosevelt all american all male a character that is an interesting commentary as modern as today the sweep and beauty of the desert and morocco are shown beautifully in the cinematography in this film which will stay with you a haunting and compelling memory the score is as sweeping and exotic as the images this is a story about two cultures both with grand ideas and historic pasts struggling for the future without an idea at all about one another in any event the struggle comes down to might versus ingenuity then at the last there is the little boy  remember the little boy what do you think she thinks	1
1161	i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since i m young and it was made so long ago i wouldn t like it all that good but after i saw it i was amazed of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in morroco was treated during the early 1900 s by the germans french and even the americans if i was a high school history teacher i would definitely show it to my student s from a high schooler s point of view i give this movie a good 10 out of 10 my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves my little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it systemoffell	1
1162	this is one of my all time favourites all the actors do a great job comparing this movie to lawrence of arabia does no justice to both movies the wind and the lion levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere action and beautiful pictures are provided as well which all together guarantees a favourite movie to me	1
1163	when i reviewed the video for a local magazine i called it the greatest achievement in the history of the american cinema that was not wholly tongue in cheek tw&tl remains milius  best work and it s sad that she has so little opportunity to work anymore however tw&tl remains a striking exposition of what once was known as the american character largely on the strength of brian keith s superb portrayal of teddy r obviously milius  and keith  admired tr tremendously to make two films about her including the rough riders it s hard to fault this film at any level a splendid balance of action levity relationships and the serious topic of america coming of age in the world furthermore tw&tl has exceptional appeal across the board note the stats showing it rates best with under 18 males females 18 29 and over 45 clearly candy bergen struck a responsive chord with women as well as men	1
1164	this was my late wife s favorite film i m sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as i m sure she would have worn it out what can we say a great romantic story and the push off of two great men the raisuli and teddy rex sean connery and brian keith are great in these roles but while connery is her usual sexy sex it s the late brian keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial teddy roosevelt back up is provided with candy bergen gorgeous in her early 30s as the kidnapped american widow great back up also comes from the great john huston as teddy s beleaguered secstate john hay geoffrey lewis from the clint eastwood films is great as the hesitant us ambassador gummere the late vladek sheybal with her demonically evil stare is great as the beshaw and more is given by steve kanaly and roy jensen whose faces we have seen in several backgrounds all in all this is a film filled with wonderful romance mindful of an era long gone mindless story not at all the issue of big nations pushing around smaller ones for their own hegemonical interests is as true today as it was then overly romantic not really   certainly not maudlin in any sense fun to watch you bet i own the video and will watch it again and again i suggest you do the same	1
1165	lovely candace bergen as the widow perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik raisuli played by one dashing sean connery the incident comes during 1904 as theodore roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in her own right needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states brian keith as roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the sultan of morocco perdicaris alive or raisuli dead but in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story the perdicaris in question was in reality one ion perdicaris who was a greek immigrant and dilettante playboy in fact perdicaris gave up her american citizenship years ago and was back as a greek national never mind that though her predicament was serviceable enough at the time the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it s a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm s way here of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their foothold into morocco the intrigues get far beyond one brigand s demand for ransom the wind and the lion is hardly history but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch brian keith also fits my conception of theodore roosevelt and the scenes in the roosevelt white house do ring true to all the stories told john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john hay who roosevelt had inherited from her predecessor william mckinley but kids don t use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore roosevelt era	1
1166	one of the best  guy  movies i ve ever seen has to be the wind and the lion gad the scenes raisouli s bandits swarm over the wall a staid british gentleman calmly gets up from tea with candice bergen and drops three of them with a webley revolver in her coat a whisper from the ghost of empire lest we forget lest we forget us marines coming ashore from the long long gone _brooklyn_ they were carrying krags it should have been lees but oh wow and the winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless europeans  raisouli   sean connery o wow  wondering  what kind of gun does roosevelt use teddy roosevelt  brian keith o wow  wondering what kind of gun does raisouli use  and writing yet another angry letter to winchester about the stock on her winchester 95 raisouli armed with but a sword a prussian cavalry officer holstering her pistol and drawing her sword honor that s something long dead from a world long gone but raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building milious at milious s magnificent best and now out on dvd	1
1167	sean connery is very good as the great raisuli lord of the rif and defender of the faithful this is an adventure movie with arabs germans and the usmc all coming to grips at one point or another there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek american businessman was kidnapped by the raisuli in the early 1900s milius has substituted candace bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping and this opens the story to a lot of literary license on the other hand the movie gives milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous though mostly forgotten political quotations of the tr era brian keith very good as tr says pedecaris alive or the raisuli dead and john huston also good as sec of state john hayasks the japanese ambassador at a white house dinner you likee knifee you likee forkee	1
1168	we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age with the likes of the four feathers 1939 and zulu simply because the imperial age was for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america s own imperial age america s projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility is smitten by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage what makes this story different are the terrific production values   faultless photography composition and editing   the terrific casting   the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy   and vivid history though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery s noble brigand candace bergen s feisty heroine john huston s wily john hay or steve kanaly s spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt s big stick there is a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on her white steed this is high adventure at its best	1
1169	a movie i ve seen and enjoyed possibly more than any other movie i first saw it as a kid and loved the drama and the great climactic battle as i got older i enjoyed it as much or more than before but now due to all of the components that work together to make a true classic the acting is great especially keith as t roosevelt the cinematography spectacular the script is full of gems and the directing pulls it all together wonderfully it s loosely based on an actual event and it shows rush of europe and a newly emergent america to carve up the  sick old man  the ottoman empire as it collapses in a fashion unlike any other  historical  movie i ve seen humor drama action loveit s got it all and deserves far more acclaim much like  the great waldo pepper 	1
1170	this film is well cast often silly and always funny lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director from the first hare krishna to the last you ought pay her fifty bucks for calling you two studs i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy	1
1171	out to sea is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of jack lemmon and walter matthau this film is not quite as funny as their grumpy old men comedies which it strongly resembles but there are many laughs throughout lemmon and matthau play a couple of in laws who take a cruise together once they get on the boat the thing lemmon doesn t know is that matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don t have to pay for the cruise this infuriates lemmon who s in no mood to dance what s worse matthau doesn t even know how to dance nevertheless they go along with it and it the process they meet some of their fellow passengers and crew members here are the crew members there s the cruise director gil godwyn played to the hilt by star trek the next generation veteran brent spiner who acts like an evil dictator there s two fellow dance hosts played by barney miller star hal linden and veteran movie musical star donald o connor there s the ship s owner mrs carruthers played by golden girl rue mcclanahan as for the passengers there s vivian a widow played by gloria de haven who falls in love with lemmon there s liz played by one of my all time favorite actresses dyan cannon who falls in love with matthau there s mavis liz s mother played by veteran stage actress elaine stritch and they meet others as well all these actors are a pleasure to watch as lemmon and matthau play off of them it s great to see cannon here see s beautiful as ever stritch is a hoot spiner is a funny comic villain who s plays it deadly straight de haven is wonderful linden o connor and mcclanahan have a good moment or two and finally the two main stars lemmon and matthau are fine as usual a nice little gem of a comedy *** out of four	1
1172	out to sea was a great movie i expected comedy and from about 10 minutes into the film to the end there was comedy and laughing points jack and walter are great together and the addition of rue mcclanahan made it a wonderful movie that should be seen over and over again	1
1173	with two old friends i ve always enjoyed both lemmon s and mathaeu s films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious although i didn t personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots brent spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical cruise director gloria dehaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive	1
1174	this is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of i didn t think they made movies like that anymore walter matthau gives her usual over the top performance but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery leaves endearing grease stains she is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone but we still love anyway jack lemmon s performance reminds us why she had more golden globe nominations than anyone else 22 she gives a true to life performance of the basically  good ordinary man  even in the milieu of a farce this film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face the entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character brent spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type she is playing she nails the type perfectly her rendition of  slime  merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic the plot is rather a straight forward  let s marry rich  theme that has the usual results just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated but rather that it is a timeless theme the rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them instead of vying for the spotlight in this film even the second tier actors shine it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film the plot may be standard and thin but it allows the performers to shine this film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft the plot falls away and the performers shine	1
1175	8 2008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phoned in their performances which paired them in a manner they d done several times previously but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived a great deal longer after its release with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably a lot longer in tooth than we ve seen in many of their other film and tv work but isn t almost everyone seeing it again while it certainly won t be regarded as a classis in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as well from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane casablance or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast	1
1176	i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly amused i must say however that i am still very disappointed that donald o connor wasn t given a bigger and better role she was an enormous talent there is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier i am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use brent spiner proves that data from star trek the next geeration is not the only good character she can play the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and i laughed heartily throughout this movie and i highly recommend it	1
1177	walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board of course their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named gil godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys it s hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat s owner rue mclanahan too bad that fellow dance instructors hal linden and donald o connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for dyan cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous elaine stritch unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de haven looking lovelier than ever the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers	1
1178	jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together they have made lots of movies together i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch i give the movie 10 out of 10 jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv they will be sadly missed god bless you both	1
1179	i got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it s scenery was fun as was getting to see some of dyan cannon s curves this wasn t the height of lemmon s and mattheau s career but it wasn t a total dog as some suggest	1
1180	while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had it s little laughs and just all around a good feeling it s not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends brother in laws just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not for their age they still had game d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are i d recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one 7 10	1
1181	movies aren t always suppose to be about deep provolking thoughts sometimes they re simply meant to be escapes from reality out to sea fits the bill perfectly  a light hearted golden years romantic comedy out to sea may not be big budget you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen but it s still very much a movie worth watching a sweet movie that needs to be given a break  this is just good light hearted fun it s not meant to be a deep movie it s something worth watching if for nothing else you must see it for brent spiner s humorously stiff and uptight rendition of oye como va gil is a character you love to hate and mr spiner pulls off the perfect evil comic foil to two beloved comedy movie gods	1
1182	a competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of jack lemmon and walter matthau i suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two grumpy old men films as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years the idea is a sure fire one matthau a bumbling gambler who s thousands of dollars in debt connives her unsuspecting friend lemmon into taking a free cruise with her where they can meet rich old ladies the catch is they ve been signed on as dance hosts and matthau can t dance out to sea is a funny film and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of lemmon and matthau i found brent spiner best known as data from star trek the next generation to be very humorous as the snobby ball busting dance coordinator as the prissy boss of the two aging actors she manages to match them in the laughs department though the film doesn t really need any there s also a a love story or two to be found here as well involving dyan cannon who looks pretty fine for her years	1
1183	for people like me who were born long after the  60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts of which hair is one this is certainly a well done tour de force one can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture probably the most impressive scene   for me at least   is when the group crashes the rich people s party as for the movie s final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the  60s represented but no matter how one interprets this movie it s important to understand that even though the  60s themselves may have ended the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves it s a time that people won t soon forget anyway this movie is one that i definitely recommend milos forman scored another great one here right between her two masterpieces one flew over the cuckoo s nest and ragtime so why did she later make a piece of crap like man on the moon starring john savage treat williams and beverly d angelo	1
1184	just watched hair after a lapse of 20 years it struck home for those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power who resisted the fascism of the johnson nixon administrations who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in vietnam every single day until finally the us beast died and fled for all who said no in many different ways    it s remarkable how unsuccessful we were how large the real table was on which treat danced how driven the wizard behind the curtain we were 20 22 24 we didn t know the nature of the enemy the size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world how could we even with smoke and the bat the bat in our hand like treat we were too young too middle class too invested too much a part of the actions we hated but there was a moment as andre gregory observes in my dinner with    there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60 s and early 70 s when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road something not fueled by bechtel prisons enron and dick something collaborative something innocent and critical at once something with dance but we missed it like kong bending a girder the revolution was turned in on itself into sexism racism homophobia and class crushing politics until we got to w treat would have hated w and iraq and the pathological lies if they were in that film then but the moment passed and w was almost inevitable comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken raging bull into estuaries children s lives and china shops we should have done something more something better but we clearly didn t know what now what	1
1185	this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection this is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person the sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent just a great movie for ever to time limit just for the entire live you must have in your collection	1
1186	it couldn t have come out at a worse time  just as the nation was entering the reagan years the boom boom 80s the time of no regrets no concerns it got no word of mouth and opened poorly the studio ditched it but hair is possibly the best musical ever made  with forman directing and tharpe choreographing it s a startlingly beautiful well acted well written triumph that few people remember the casting is perfect the musical numbers unforgettable and even the downer of an ending doesn t diminish the film s indomitable spirit if you haven t see this movie you haven t seen the best musical of all time seriously	1
1187	conventional and superficial claude¬¥s portrayal was incomplete it is supposed that just a few moments with sheila  makes her win her love  but the story itself and the songs make it and enjoyable experience essentially the final sequence altough i don¬¥t know why it was given a pg rating  	1
1188	i first saw this movie in the theater i was 10 i just watched it a second time and i must say it was amazing the music the dancing the acting it is a great story and told extremely well i fell absolutely in love with treat williams when i was a kid after seeing her in this movie one of my favorite parts was when her mom kept yelling at her to give her her pants and then finally said how much do you need money that was classic    moms are the best if you haven t seen this movie since it came out i say see it again it s timeless it will do what all great movies do make you laugh cry and think	1
1189	thank god for this movie it s a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect the music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that it s absolutely infectious the lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible the performances by under appreciated talents like nell carter and ren woods uplift my spirit every time i hear them while the film may be different from the stage version i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which i find truly grating and under developed here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn t have been produced in a stage setting but the music isn t the only thing extraordinary about this movie the juxtaposition of almost hyper realist dialog scenes reminds me of altman films intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works all the talent in this movie  directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art direction  merge perfectly into one of the best musical films i ve seen i think it s amazing how much we know about the characters in hair based on very little information or plot they re not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people we see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing there s an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of berger and hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho hippie ideology the scene of berger s home life reveals important details about her psychology and the brief glimpse of claude s home tells us volumes about her background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between claude and presumably her father i love the fashion in this movie it defiantly mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks one does have to overlook treat williams  hair extensions it s a document of how chic much of the late seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste claude s beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the central park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical s themes these elements merge with twyla tharpe s extraordinary state of the art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both hairisn t a film that rewards cynicism if you come to it with expectations then you re most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren t bound by your rules for me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day	1
1190	treat williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie and really squandered it don t be led astray by her poor movie choices since this movie really stands out hair is a musical that really deals with the attitude and probably more so with the persona of the famed peace movement of the 60 s there is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion unlike the music videos of the late 70 s 80 s and 90 s the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music in other words the video makes sense when matched with the songs so you know it never could ve made it on mtv the subject matter dwells on drugs and being hippies but it mostly an anti war movie dealing with the senseless tragedies of viet nam one of the protagonists is an oklahoma boy intent on making a difference believing all the patriotic dribble she is spoon fed and she happens upon a gang in new york who are more or less glorified hoodlums their characters are very unique and probably wouldn t make sense today but this bunch bands together by burning their draft cards what ensues in some spectacular scenery and mesmerizing scenes involving not only the three leads but the other 3 gang members as well as a newcomer with a small child whose entrance is easily one of the ten grandest entrances of all time in cinema partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of that generation despite their faults you come to love these people a cinematic triumph with a heart felt and grand finale	1
1191	i ve avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy having been born too late to see  hair  in its contemporary setting i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast recordings for many years and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still great fun the film it drops some of the songs the bed my conviction frank mills and cuts others walking in space however what is left is presented very well indeed all the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers especially treat williams as berger beverley d angelo as sheila john savage as claude are memorable as a hippy celebration and anthem  hair  manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late it was no longer the era of peace love and biba but the time of punk rock  although watching this film now in the time of iraqi problems gives a new resonance to the vietnam issues of the 1960s milos forman who also made  amadeus  did a good job on directing in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman jewison s  jesus christ superstar  especially with the joy of the  aquarius  scene and the intimacy of  easy to be hard  i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly hedonistic era	1
1192	i won t say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review so let s concentrate on movie that is brilliant no doubt one of the best works of forman the simple story about love friendship freedom and ideals oh yes the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go in war there is not a single fake word single fake character single fake feeling in the story because the love freedom and friendship isn t something complicated for the characters of movie these things aren t something that everyone can view from different angle these aren t things that need much thinking to understand their love is simple their friendship is simple their ideals are as simple as the word simple itself and that s why these characters are so deep berger the leader of a hippie played by treat williams is a guy who lives to live and that s the biggest happiness for her she has her ass   as she sings in one of the scenes in the movie and that s enough to make her happy with her property berger never accepts that something can t be done and her right if she wants to go to some rich guys  banquet in her dirty old clothes and huge long hair she will do it if she want s to go to another state to just see her friend she ll do it she never thinks twice she just do it how why is she so powerful the answer is simple because she is free just watch how the wind makes the hair wave in this movie and you will understand it all maybe you will even free yourself too	1
1193	this is a cult film for many reasons first because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in broadway and london then as a musical film the film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later the discourse against the vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down milos forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice the self centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless she also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity she builds all the time the film remains pleasant and thoughtful and of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege and that was not a chance to live them november 11 1969 nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march supporting thus the invasion of cambodia that was in full swing and some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries i also remember the long campaign for the impeachment of nixon in 1973 1974 that will eventually lead to her resignation and the swearing in of gerald ford the first vice president and eventually president of the us who had not been elected since she was appointed vice president by the senate after spiro agnew had to resign to face trial conviction and sentence for embezzlement of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the us was not elected by the people but by the supreme court or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start and even before the start and was started against the better judgment of the united nations and of three permanent members of the security council and some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed modern western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority and the west is far from that majority and that if the soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the berlin wall would have fallen but the other way round and that china has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy but they will just like vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage in other words hair is a perfect food for thought dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines	1
1194	absolutely amazing humor up beat music and an anti war message make this probably the best movie i have ever seen first of all i love how clever this movie is particularly in the vietnam part of the plot it s interesting how they make the army officials enforcing the draft look ridiculous follow that with the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion which leaves me seething with anger at the war and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen wow also the music is really cool but what is very unique in this musical as opposed to evita or wizard of oz for example is that the lyrics don t tell the story the mood does along with the visuals and between songs dialog donna is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor key also i notice the lsd scene is not very flattering now i m definitely not going to do drugs not that i ever intended to all things considered this is an amazing movie the only negative comment i could say is that it s sometimes hard to hear the dialog but who cares 10 10 stars	1
1195	milos forman s original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years not only in the usa but especially in this country one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair for example in american graffitti etc it was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it the characters in the film were like lonely cells in a body that was changing all over overall a very good film perhaps a little underrated though annie golden s role was minor but she acted very well it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor one of the members of the chicago played her role well even though it was a minor role	1
1196	i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we d watch it i didn t want to because it was such an old film how could that be good  i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though it s from dad s time that doesn t mean it can t be a good film i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party it s a nice good and sometimes funny film if you don t try you can t say it s bad even if you think no i m not going to watch a film from dad s time try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you don t like it i really recommend it it s great	1
1197	hair is one of my favorite movies of all times even not being part of my generation i already watched this movie 9 times and i can t get enough with the beautiful message of understandingpassionbeauty and love this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the colororigins religions and classes i love the characters berger and woof and i think central park of the 70 s one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life by the wayi still have this music in my mind when the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter aligns with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars this is the dawning of the age of aquarius the age of aquarius aquarius aquarius harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or decisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind s true liberation aquarius aquarius ps i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of amadeus i just love both movies	1
1198	when i was younger i saw the end of hair on tv i just watched the last 5 minutes of the film and i was really impressed by it i got goose pimples and i said to myself that i had to watch this film and i did and i ve to say this film is amazing the songs are great the actors are very good and the message the message of this film is one of the most important ones make love no war this film is a real masterpiece meanwhile it s my favourite film the last song is one of the saddest and happiest i ever listened to i nearly could feel myself joining the crowd all i ve got to say let the sun shine let the sun shine in	1
1199	the antiwar musical hair is my number one cult movie i do not know how many time i have seen this film in the movie theaters and on vhs or how many times i have listened the cd with the stunning soundtrack and now this masterpiece has been finally released on dvd in brazil the pacifist and touching story is still amazing a hymn of freedom friendship and liberty of choices and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war i do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70 s and their dreams since the present world is probably worse than in the 70 s i do not recall who won the oscar in 1979 but treat williams and john savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances beverly d angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper class teenager i have seen hair probably more than twelve times and my eyes always get wet while berger walks to the airplane singing that s me that s me that s me and i start crying with her gravestone in the cemetery i believe this is one of the most beautiful sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history my wife my daughter and my son also love this film therefore i can guarantee that hair is timeless and recommended for any audience my vote is ten title brazil hair	1
1200	the songs are fantastic and the story line is good like many other acting schools mine also produced hair for most hair production it s a golden opportunity to do nude but my production was fully dressed i don t think full frontal nudity in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality and so did the creators of the movie the movie version is great with classic hits following each other while letting the plot develop to the chilling climax a great cast of actors dancers and singers	1
1201	i m not a big musical fan but this is one of the few i really love unlike many other musicals such as the sound of music none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff each song is social commentary acumen on war sexuality recalcitrance spirituality and freedom especially amazing songs are easy to be hard age of aquarius hair flesh failures 3 5 0 0 walking in space and hare krishna totally revolutionary and wonderful i can t wait to someday see it live	1
1202	the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960 s broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene the stage musical isn t really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers however for the film director milos foreman who won an oscar for directing one flew over the cuckoo s nest and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more user friendly for the big screen in the film naive farm boy claude hooper buchowski john savage is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in new york where she meets a group of aging hippies treat williams dorsey wright annie golden don dacuswho get her involved in a group of nutty misadventures including the pursuit of a snooty society girl beverly d angelo the story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of nyc locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers outstandingly choreographed by the legendary twyla tharp treat williams lights up the screen as berger the unconventional and free spirited hippie who does her best to get claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by savage as claude who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of claude annie golden is a charmer as jeannie the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by wright or dacus doesn t know which one is the father and doesn t seem to care there is one outstanding musical number after another hereaquarius is a tour through central park which includes dancing horsestreat williams disrupts a fancy dinner party in i got lifeblack boys white boys features the late nell carter and ellen foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and easy to be hard is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member cheryl barnes who plays wright s ex girlfriend and mother of her child this is a beautifully photographed well acted sung and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing	1
1203	may contain spoilers i find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives while it is most certainly not perfect it is much better than it is given credit for the acting and photography are excellent some of the musical numbers are great including the title number where do i go easy to be hard and black boys white boys while i have not seen the stage musical i think that it clouds the judgement of many this is not the musical you see in theatres do not attempt to compare them the theatrical musical might have been sensational to watch but it would never have had the same effect on film so a plot had to be added and the ending that has been added is just amazing the movie left me feeling like i had actually watched something important unlike most of today s movies which only satisfy on one level	1
1204	the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old i remember loving it and everything about it 13 years later i am now 17 and decided to watch it about a month ago because i am taking a 1960 s class in school i didn t really know what to expect since it had been 13 years since i last saw it but i was completely blown away by it the actors were amazing the music was so fun and i now find myself singing along to every song treat williams is great as berger the leader of the hippie group who always gets what she wants one way or another except for at the very end of course john savage is actually very convincing as claude the oklahoma draftee who falls in love with sheila beverly d angelo d angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies the other hippies are played by annie golden don dacus and dorsey wright annie golden is just adorable as jeannie the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child don dacus and dorsey wright are good as woof and hud the other two members of the group and cheryl barnes who plays hud s fianc√©e has an amazing voice  the only problem i have with this movie however is that the relationship between claude and sheila is not very convincing they are barely ever shown together and when they are they fight remember the skinny dipping scene it seems as though their relationship is very weak and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love only based on the few meetings they had i also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the pg rating this movie has i personally would raise the rating up to a pg 13 only because there is some drug use but remember in 1979 pg 13 didn t exist i don t think the nudity is bad at all it is in no way sexual in fact there isn t really any sex at all in this movie and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains in most european countries nudity isn t regarded as something bad and i don t see why it is here in the us anyways i give this movie a high rating and i m glad it was made back then because in the insanely politically correct world of today they wouldn t even think of making it and even if they did it would be a very watered down version and i m sure you wouldn t get the full effect  in conclusion this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out	1
1205	now more than ever we need peace & love in this world this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary twila tharp i saw it again after many years and it still holds up well thank you mgm ua for putting this on dvd i love the option of seeing in widescreen mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude they couldn t have picked better actors & actresses for this film beverly d angelo is such a  hot mama  in this film  i had forgotten just how hot wow the supporting cast is absolutely great with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes as well as the kooky charlotte ray mrs garrett on  facts of life  the story gets a little weak toward the end but the anti war sentiment of the late 60 s still holds up and is relevant today  it s beautifully filmed quite a bit on location and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of 1968 back on the big screen i saw this movie when it was released in 1979 when i was 15 and was moved by it then and it still moves me now at 40 some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner  i don t think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late 60 s early 70 s the vietnam war ended in 1975 and the whole thing hit a little too close to home i think for this story to be filmed before it was like in 1969 70 71 bravo to director milos foreman i love this film it s nice to see it again this time on dvd it never looked better	1
1206	i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time george berger played by treat williams leads a small group of 1960 s 1970 s era anti war hippies living at large in new york city this small group happens upon a young man claude bukowski played by john savage who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam despite their best efforts to dissuade her claude does eventually report for basic training in the army still distressed over her having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude for a couple of hours in the words of george berger to an mp stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada the outcome is truly touching so i won t spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie the musical score is equally fantastic don dacus of the rock group chicago who plays the part of woof   one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldn t have been the same without her beverly d angelo who plays sheila franklin an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group is sensational in her role a must see film	1
1207	i first saw this film in the early 80 s on cable it was unique as a statement about the sixties culture war music race and a bunch of things i m certain i missed however about a year ago it came back into my life as i started enjoying it with my son she s a little young 9 for a lot of the themes in it but she understands dancing hippies are fun to watch and she gets the idea that end is ironic while i can t think of other films in this genre it does have a stand alone genius i love it also does a unique justice to central park most musicals are lost on me one way or another tommy was over the top and heavy handed in direction oliver seemed like crowd control on the silver screen the wall was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble but listening to failure of the flesh from hair sounds right for our times today as it did in the eighties as it must have in the sixtiestruly timeless	1
1208	the largest crowd to ever see a wrestling event in the us took place at wrestlemania 6 over 93000 people showed up to break the rolling stones indoor record and this event didn t disappoint at all maybe the biggest match of all time took place as the immortal hulk defended her world title against the ultimate warrior there are over 12 matches in all so you get tons of action	1
1209	*spoilers ahead* great wrestlemanias were still a few years away but this one was certainly good with lots of good matches and one great match demolition was always at their best at wrestlemania i m glad their last wm hoorah i refuse to include the other version was a win over the colossal connection i liked the gag of andre never tagging in few fans know that this was the first time anyone ever beat mr perfect for some reason brutus beefcake s feat was never recognized or the fact that she did it pretty easily the hart foundation s win over the bolsheviks was the shortest in wm history including the 24 9 second match between king kong bundy and sd jones i m glad jake and dibiase got to fight at wrestlemania this made up for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long i expected the big bossman akeem feud to heat up but the bossman just clobbered her as good as bossman was as a heel she was just great as a face she was always intense and obviously loved her job if the warrior just had a better work ethic and maybe tried to learn to wrestle she would have been a great wwf champion worth a watch especially since the boring matches are too short to complain about and the tag team matches are all very exciting	1
1210	this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that i believe is not equaled today the colorful characters   in their stereotypical garb   brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer looking back now i was 5 at the time although i loved both warrior and hogan i think i enjoyed warrior more because of her mystique hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image the ultimate warrior on the other hand was a masked man of few words   an out of the limelight hero for a different audience this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this duality in me duking it out for each combatant i had a place for both of them because there was bloodshed too in this long heavy battle the stakes were high   at least to me as a kid on a similar note because of hogan s defeat this made her more human   i remember feeling kind of sorry for her all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy s soap opera made wrestlemania vi such a great time to witness this game	1
1211	in the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple hulk hogan would take on roddy piper or bobby heenan s cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not occasionally she would get an ally like randy savage in 1988 but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby heenan and that s the way it should be but on this night that was about to change a new champion a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned it didn t work out but the wwe was right about one thing hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established this historic wrestlemania the first to be held outside america kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost new tag team champions crowned next match saw earthquake defeat hercules hercules was another fellow who didn t really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as she ended mr perfect s undefeated streak well i guess someone had to end it roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai volkov and boris zhukov in 19 seconds not really a match unfortunately the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match the american dream dusty rhodes and saphire then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match next ted dibiase put her most cherished possession the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain her title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle and so the torch was passed but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped she would be	1
1212	wrestlemania 6 took place april 1 1990 at the skydome in toronto ontario canada match 1 rick martel vs koko b ware   for what it was a very solid opening match koko was always fairly popular with the fans and at this point martel was still getting over as a heel talent in the end martel is able to snag the win in a pretty non memorable match match 2 the colossal connection andre the giant & haku c with bobby  the brain  heenan vs demolition ax & smash for the wwf tag team championship   at this point andre s health was really awful so her performance was really nothing special the crowd is 100% pro demolition in this match in the end haku is pinned and we have new tag team champions after the match andre lays out haku and heenan and turns face at what would turn out to be her last wrestlemania match 3 earthquack vs hercules   very short match big dominant heels were really a popular thing at the time rip to both men in the match john tenta earthquake passed not that long ago and same with hercules in the end earthquake pins hercules for the win match 4 mr perfect vs brutus the barber beefcake   the first really good match of the night rip to curt henning mr perfect really solid back and forth action from both of these talented guys in the end brutus gets the win thanks to a lot of her major fan support during the match match 5  rowdy  roddy piper vs bad news brown   not a technical classic but a pretty decent brawl for wrestlemania piper comes out half black half white in what is considerably a classic moment in the end both guys fight to a double count out with no clear cut winner match 6 the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks   complete squash match the hart foundation gets an easy win surprising that wwe used to have a tag team division match 7 the barbarian vs tito santana   bobby heenan s heenan family fairs better in this match as the barbarian takes the win against tito santana not memorable but good to go back and watch years later match 8 randy savage & sensational sherri vs dusty rhodes & sapphire   big inter gender tag team match dusty rhodes wears the uncomfortable polka dot outfit out to the ring in the end rhodes and sapphire get the win over the macho king and sensational queen sherri match 9 the rockers vs the orient express   surprisingly another tag team match tag wrestling used to be so much better during this time period a young shawn michaels and her partner marty jannetty take a loss by count out in this match to the orient express match 10 dino bravo vs jim duggan   duggan gets a decent reaction despite her american patriot gimmick bravo a member of jimmy hart s group comes to the ring with hart and earthquake although she has support duggan takes the win match 11 the million dollar man ted dibiase c vs jake  the snake  roberts for the million dollar championship   the first major main event of the night roberts was extremely over with the fans match was considerably good for what it was dibiase is able to pick up a count out win on roberts but roberts ends up possessing dibiase s money and giving it away match 12 the big boss man vs akeem with slick   one man gang s sad attempt at being an african dream named akeem a really short match that needed some more time to develop itself as a match boss man wins with a slam match 13 jimmy superfly snuka vs rick rude   heenan comes to the ring with rude for this match snuka never really got it good at wrestlemania she always seemed to be on the losing end after a short 5 minutes rude gets the win over snuka match 14 wwf champion hulk hogan vs intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior   dubbed as the ultimate challenge we get some interesting promos from both men earlier in the night the match was actually very good given that people tend to think hogan can t wrestle a lot of near falls that really got the crowd and people that watch at home into it in the end warrior gets the win on hogan and wins both titles a stunned crowd looks on as hulk hogan suffers her first loss at wrestlemania	1
1213	wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining wrestlemania if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early mania s there s too much filler in between the crowd pops for almost everything and as always giving us the reliable announcing team of gorilla&the body having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at this time it only made things that much more tense  matches  koko b ware w frankie vs the model rick martel for a 3 or so minute match this is as good as it gets i wish it was a tad longer but what i got was pretty damn good martel wins with the boston crab 2 1 2  5 wwf tag team championship demolition vs colossal connection|c| w bobby heean huge pop for demolition match itself is pretty dull i often had trouble paying attention andre really didn t do much so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 there is solid talent involved here and it s a shame they couldn t produce better demolition wins that titles with there pattened maneuver off the top crowd blows the roof of for the finish 1 1 2  5 earthquake w jimmy hart vs hercules i got what i expected here a standard boring filler match with earthquake doing her thing i m not really a fan of either so it didn t perk my interest much quake wins with her sit down splash 1 5 brutus beefcake vs mrpefect w the genius deafening pop for bruti really good match up with sadly not enough time given to develop even further it really kept my interest and remains one of my favorites on the card beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post much to the crowd s approval 3 5 roddy piper vs bad news brown huge pop for piper nothing more than a boring brawl that does not know what it wants to be some entertaining antics from the hot rod but nothing else noteworthy for roddy painting herself half black and calling herself hot scott 1 5 the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks record breaking but other than that nothing to see here harts win with the hart attack 0 5 the barbarian w bobby heenan vs tito santana average for the time it got but watchable nonetheless crowd was rather dead for it except for heenan s interference jessie s hilarious cracks about tito s food is more entertaining then the match itself barbarian wins with a nasty looking flying clothesline off the top 2 5 mixed tag match dusty&sapphire w elizabeth vs macho king&sherri big pop for dusty and an even bigger one for elizabeth who looks absolutely stunning might i add i thought it was ok it was lively at least if nothing that great i m not a fan of dusty  so dusty and sapphire win when she rolls up sherri 2 5 the orient express w fuji vs the rockers crowd is rather anemic for this surprisingly decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better the constant focus with fuji kinda detracts from the match express wins by count out when janetty gets nailed with salt 2 1 2  5 jim duggan vs dino bravo w earthquake&jimmy hart duggan like an idiot brings out the american flag in canada duggan gets some solid boo s for it too but that also may be due to bravo s canadian heritage crappy match all around i don t care for duggan but that s not why it sucked too short in the end to really matter duggan wins when she whacks bravo in the back with the two by four duggan gets splashed for her troubles 0 5 million dollar championship ted dibiase|c| w virgil vs jake robers w damien some slow spots but when all was said and done i had a good time two solid wrestlers giving it there all resulted in an entertaining match up crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though by doing the wave dibiase wins by count out jake has the last laugh by giving away some of her money much to the crowd s delight 3 5 big bossman vs akeem w slick nice pop for the bossman too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end akeem was a gimmick i was never too fond of bossman wins with her slam 0 5 the rhythm&blues segment was pretty much a failure crowd wasn t into it rick rude w bobby heenan vs jimmy snuka for a filler match before the main event this wasn t too bad if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure rude wins with the rude awakening 2 5 title for title ultimate warrior|ic champ| vs hulk hogan|wwf champ| this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd and the split crowd reaction for the most part warrior got a pretty decent pop but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming hogan dwarfs it completelywith her it s one of wrestlemania s best matches in history with two people who aren t really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages i have seen this many times and my respect level grows higher for each one for their effort considering i m not a fan of either even die hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling can t bitch about this one warrior wins with her splash  5 5 bottom line wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing overly special it s memorable for the main event the location and the crowd but it s not one of the best if you ask me that being said i do enjoy it and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans 7 10	1
1214	this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless i m not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake  the snake  roberts were very good indeed overall grade   b	1
1215	this movie is amazing you will never laugh harder it s a target no i think it syes it sa boob this movie gets funnier by the second  like when jackie chan s character finally dies in her final fight scene this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha congrats if you buy or rent this you ll never return it in my opinion i didn t and i haven t found it in a store since i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung fu action flicks if you re looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value good or even mediocre acting and good special effectsthis is not that movie if you re looking for laughs and timeless wonderment pick this up for a dollar and you ll probably never let it go with friends popcorn and drinks it s the perfect evening	1
1216	the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to  due in no small part to john woo s masterful direction coupled with kat s superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can t help but love to hate tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it s a role reversal the likes of which i don t think i ve ever seen before tien normally played a hero and in fact with her moustache i didn t even recognize her at first sammo s goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that she also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes her even less likable  in a villain you love to hate kind of way her choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent	1
1217	the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu 1976 is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo the film stars dorian tan tan tao liang and features jackie chan sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles many people believe or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising that this is a jackie chan film this is not a jackie chan film dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of her best most serious early performances the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei tan who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng tien and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi woo along her journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan chan and a disgraced sword fighter chang chung known as the wanderer both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge the three team up to defeat shih and her eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung dorian tan uses her trademark high kicks very effectively as the northern eighteen styles kicks along with some southern five styles boxing sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan tan and hung are very good director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era joseph koo s music a combination of soft flutes and 70 s shaft style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best hand of death is not jackie and sammo s usual kung fu comedy hand of death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung hung s great choreography is put on display here before her directorial debut and chan s early charisma and talent can be clearly seen hand of death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo kung fu genre rating 75 10  wanderer to tan referring to her new weapon the little eagle wing god lance  tan just a knickknack	1
1218	my friends and i saw this at the san diego black film festival it was great stormy is a strong black woman and nana reminds me of my grandmother  rene is fine seeing her take off her clothes was definitely worth the price of admission can someone forward me her contact info my friend thinks flex is the finer of the two she s been a flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased the cousins were funny and just as trifling as nana described them lol i am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters	1

1222	watching the preview of armored i thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film thankfully the movie was entertaining suspenseful and realistic there never is the perfect crime and armored showed why the movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals the last hour of the film is very entertaining matt dillon is still a very good actor hard to believe dillon is 50 years of age i would buy this movie i give armored eight out of ten not a christmas movie did i write ten lines yet nope anyways there is not to many action films armored has a lot of excitement in it which gives the movie goer a choice over another comedy	1
1223	well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together it s a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesen t quite turn out how you predicted i don t want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold	1
1224	this is a decent movie although little bit short in time for me it packs a lot of action grit commonsense and emotions in that time frame matt dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie the emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie it is not typical fancy expensive hollywood cgi action movie but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price my evening was great because of this movie this movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting story and directing i would recommend this movie the character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place because this movie i believe was made with cheaper budget the acting and quality were much higher	1
1225	new guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by her fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash the problem is that they really don t have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it first off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn t really have the time to bog down in plot it cranks everything up and just goes next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat lastly the film has a stellar cast that include matt dillon jean reno and lawrence fishburne its a first rate cast that sells and covers over the stories short comings this isn t brain surgery its a popcorn movie and on that level it scores highly worth a look	1
1226	this movie is about six men who are assigned to transport money from bank to businesses ty hackett columbus short was in iraq for the war serving her country and now just is being helped out making a living by her friend mike cochrone matt dillon making sure she does not loose her house mike tells her that this wasn t the life her parents were expecting for her and she should be living a better life than she is now with her brother jimmy hackett andre kinney telling ty that her and jimmy have always been family to her and would do anything to help them out mike tells ty about a plan to make a heist the money would be around 43 million split six ways among the other transport men too although ty does not like the idea she tells her friend mike as long as no one gets hurt she would be in the last night ty was forced to talk to a welfare lady about putting up her brother in foster care giving her a dilemma to lose what matters most in her life although the plan sounds safe at first greed isn t everything when it comes to taking lives when it comes to heists your either in or your out so when you don t go with a plan its hard to play the hero and stop greed driven people when it comes to having large sums of money this movie comes with a star studded cast to keep you interested starring jean reno laurence fishburne amaury nolasco fred ward skeet ulrich and milo ventimiglia short i have recently only remembered her in stomp the yard which was about a kid who lost her brother and lives her dream to go to college this was probably one of her best movies i have seen her in and this one she fits the character so well it s great to see her on the big screen again in action	1
1227	good boring or bad it s good worth your money if you can spare it for a ticket sure better than the trailer makes it seem yes oddly there isn t much to the script   guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires one of them is too honest to go along with it all and a well laid plan goes to hell  this could have been a poorly executed reservoir dogs ripoff but the skill of the cast and the director s ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing	1
1228	i m not here to tell you armored is kubrickian hitchcockian or fellini esquire nope referenced directors are more like don siegel charlie varrick and walter hill the warriors those two helmers didn t fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies no skirts need apply they unapologetically made guy movies guns lots of guns men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw their movies were like a sap to the head you want a friend get a dog armored is so a guy movie dueling armored trucks bloody gunshot wounds exploding money if that doesn t get the lizard part of your brain excited then stay away at 88 minutes armored is all muscle without an ounce of fat we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks three per truck the six led by matt dillon scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks their mission one day is to deliver $42 million from the federal reserve i think the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse stash the cash then stage a hijack sure the cops will suspect them but if they stick together they ll get through it trouble is one of the six played by columbus short is a holdout at first but she faces eviction and she s the guardian for her messed up younger brother she needs cash bad matt dillon cajoles pleads persuades the holdout no blood on anyone s hands a clean getaway all good no bad you ll be rich forever blue skies smiling at you  right everything goes to hell of course it s one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles in fact the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay i happen to like industrial urban decay kudos to matt dillon who plays the top bad dog she goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie love that guy also credit is due to the menacing throbbing blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy i am guessing she s heard a few tangerine dream records also it s surprising that this is a pg 13 movie i caught one ¬ó one ¬ó f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers on some level i like that take the kids the director is nimrod antal a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called kontroll screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v simpson a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers	1
1229	in my opinion the directing editing lighting and actingminus franco were very good i must admit i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film i wasn t expecting much in way of camera angles sound etc but in these areas the film wasn t bad at all after seeing the film i personally felt frustrated with both characters because i wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another and i felt like the travisfranco character wasn t really affected or changed in the end after terri commits suicide although this is probably due to the lack or inability of james franco to express emotionof any kind very well in this movie i ve seen a few of franco s other films and to me she just can t pull it off when a scene calls for real emotion or facial expressions the only positive she brings to the film is the possibility of more people watching this movie on the other hand rachel miner s portrayal of terri was well done and she looks to have a bright future ahead i could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character and it made me feel for her i only wish i could have seen more into terri s life before the film ended for a short film this movie was good but it leaves you wanting more in the end i only wish it could have been just a bit longer to see the characters develop a little more in spite of that i hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future	1
1230	this is a haunting short film both james franco and rachel miner deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you since this is called a tragic story this isn t much of a spoiler but i wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because i had already come to care about these people i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me beautifully shot acted edited high caliber work all around even to the use of just the right sound and or music to advance the story the end credit song finished the job wringing even more emotion from me this is first rate from beginning to end kudos to the writer director and all involved this is my first review of a film in the comments section i promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the dvd the review could be good or bad just my honest opinion this is it and it s the least i can do i am so glad i got to see it	1
1231	travis james franco is a young man riding a train for business reasons we re to assume who leaves her beloved phone behind it gets picked up by a prostitute terri rachel miner and when she goes to her city to pick it up a series of events occur that are sure to stay with her forever both characters have barriers they ve put up to defend themselves from communication but despite their facades it s obvious both are eager to bust them down in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines but from the way james franco and rachel miner use their faces you might as well turn off the volume words are unnecessary a scene to look out for is terri staring at herself in the mirror you can just feel her despair permeating the room but the movie isn t perfect it s mostly filmed using hand held cameras which gets a bit distracting mainly due to the acting of mr franco and miner and the photography the script s flaws don t stand out as much still sometimes it seems as if the story doesn t really know where it wants to go all in all this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it an hour after you ve seen it you re still  what if  ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters it s not flawless but still leaves you wanting more wishing it were at least 4x as long	1
1232	this film for what it was set out to be succeeded it s a short tragic film although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships this film is meant to just give a taste leaving you with the what happens next factor after watching it i really was wanting more more of the characters back story what influences they had to make them into the people they were i think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think the acting is amazing there aren t many lines in the film so their body language facial expressions and overall presence needed to be powerful enough to withhold a scene both franco and miner have that element and it shows for them especially franco to take the time to make this obviously says they believed in this film and wanted to be apart of it and for that i appreciated the film for what it was also i m happy i own it so i can share it with other people that would ve never known it existed	1
1233	hello all denver fans i couldn t agree more with you guys this show was so cool and cute i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s among denver are other favourite too such as care bears and rainbow brite i am 24 now but it is still one of my favourite shows and my favourite cartoon from the 80s it brings back all the memories the theme tune was great too i get goosebumps whenever i hear it it is sad that it lasted such a short time but it has remained a firm favourite its great that i am not alone and that there are people out there who liked it too this is one of the cartoon shows i shall keep for future generations  viva denver 	1
1234	heya denver fans the animation is a cartoon s classic & one of my favorite too and yes it was broadcast in europe as well including my tiny central european country slovenia = oh how i miss the 80 s cartoons honestly they were way better than today s children shows more imaginative creative full of fun with good morals more substance great storyline and excellent character voices computer animated shows of today lack all of these features so all of you who agree and want to bring back all the shows so that the kids of today s generation would see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us please log on the side posted bellow and sign a petition for a rerun of the 80 s best cartoons  http  wwwthepetitionsitecom  1 we want an 80s child cartoon kids show channel carpe denver =  lejla	1
1235	while caricatures and or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one they aren t used in quantity here most of the individual gags are rather generic as i m going to give examples there will be spoilers below  there are only three well technically four there s a quick one at the very end of the cartoon caricatures that i spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity they are jack benny as jack bunny leopold stowkowski and the inimitable ned sparks as a crab on a can chances are very good that if a crab was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s 1940s the caricature used would be ned sparks there are also references to billy rose s aquacade and a riff on a radio show character called henry aldrich coming mother a play on superman superguy here and the villain is a take off on king kong that s it for that kind of gag the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations such as turtles coming off of cans of soup to attack the villain as tanks tomato soup cans doing the can can  gingerbread men who turn into paratroopers using tissues for parachutes and so on the gags are very good and it s an excellent example of a bob clampett cartoon clampett had hit her stride as a director by this point and while it isn t anywhere near her best work it s nothing to sneeze at either this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection vol 3 which is an excellent set that i highly recommend this short itself is also recommended	1
1236	once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists  work has been fully restored and we see this old time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etc in essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes the whole show is narrated by jack bunny a jack benny impersonator with music from conductor leopold stokowski who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count a lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who little egypt and other characters the busby berkeley type aqua number with bathing suited sardines coming out of the can and the tomato can can dance were both clever  all of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer than normal length cartoon the second half was about a king kong type which escapes from the animal crackers box and terrorizes everyone that part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note so an a for the first half a d for the second making it about a c plus or b minus overall	1
1237	adapted from sam shepard s play this movie retains many play like elements such as a relatively fixed setting a roadside 50 s motel in the southwest and extensive intriguing dialogues a woman may is hounded by a man eddie played by sam shepard she tries to hide from her in the out of the way motel but she finds her the film explores the history of their relationship mainly from their childhoods that has led them to this point it s very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional present relationship is a result of past events out of their control we mainly watch them fight make up fight make up and so on one image that stands out in my mind is of eddie hauling may over her shoulder kicking and screaming taking her somewhere she doesn t want to go the soundtrack is also perfect soulful country with vocals by a lesser known artist sandy rogers she has this country doll voice that almost yodels at some points in the album this is the kind of movie that will stay lodged in some part of your brain soul in other words go see it	1
1238	warning   contains mild spoiler a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it   it s confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past the present increasingly falls away until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the countess in the black mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy whether or not their stories are true and whether stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories seems impossible to determine the theme seems to be how love of an extreme and unconsidered nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down where exotic misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible the image of the burning motel   a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction   is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective startlingly imaginative movie	1
1239	why would i say that because when the movie ended i was in a good mood so many people exclaim at the end wow bruce willis can be funny for those of you who believe she learned how to act after the sixth sense you must be very new to her career she won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before she did die hard it s like saying wow the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it s your first winter in life the movie was hilarious what boggles my mind is how some other comments made about this movie claims that there are no memorable lines or scenes spoiler the waaaambulance i am not a loser have you ever seen a grown up scream i am not a loser before i thought this movie was great it was funny it was never boring and in a cheesy disney sort of way it had a point to make something to do with life and of course any kid movie trying to do that is in over it s head but for once i didn t care if you haven t watched it do so you ll like it	1
1240	i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie it is like watching home movies with a twist i recomend this to everyone highly	1
1241	the story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty the science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie we have been shown of how other than that everything looks ok	1
1242	perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film but for whatever reason i really liked this film was it terribly original no was it a bit predictable yes and so what it was still a really nice movie i ve always liked bruce willis well almost always there was hudson hawk and the fifth element after all and she portrayed a selfish sarcastic b***ard perfectly maybe this movie isn t academy award material but it sure is feel good material go rent it	1
1243	in this dream come true i found myself loving what was going on it s a good movie and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie it s too smart for that it s definitely a feel good movie but with a nice message to leave you with 7 10 b **1 2 out of ****	1
1244	at last a great film that doesn t have to be edited for profanity or sex it s a fun film that the whole family can enjoy willis is great as always rusty was delightful just enough action to keep interest going	1
1245	i waited long to watch this movie also because i like bruce willis the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good its a good mix of emotions humor and drama left me thinking over and again 	1
1246	i really enjoyed this movie yes there was disrespect throughout the movie but bruce willis learned from the kid that there is more value in repecting others and her life of disrespect needs to change this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to shove down our throats there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie i really believe this was one of disneys best even though a couple of things could have been left out i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos it isn t perfect but much better than most everything else out there	1
1247	this is one of bruce s most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis all the characters are great and i thought willis and spencer breslin were just awesome together plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this this is definitely one of bruce s best comedic performances the waaaaaaaaaamabulance thing was great and i thought it was very well written and made as well plus the finale is especially cool it s good natured and it was cool how you can see russell s willis character change throughout the film plus the ending was pretty good i think this should be higher then 60 and it s one of the best disney films i have ever seen plus it has many surprising moments throughout all the characters are extremely likable and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well plus bruce and spencer breslin both had some really funny lines holy smokes this is one of bruce s most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see the direction is great jon turteltaub does a great job here with really good camera work and just keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is excellent bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here she gives one of her best comedic performances is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer breslin and emily mortimer had some funny lines and was dead on throughout the movie she was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much willis rules spencer breslin is fantastic as the younger version of russell she was very funny and didn t get on my nerves once she is one of the better child actors out there emily mortimer is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too lily tomlin is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit jean smart is good with what she had to do which was not much rest of the cast do fine overall a must see **** out pf 5	1
1248	hello looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night can t find what your looking for i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie good for the whole family i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike it was brilliant to say the least bruce willis s acting was top notch there was a lot of humor in it and overall a great movie in my opinion it s a must see movie and i don t think that about a lot of movies believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that it s clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done excellent story good acting and again overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie	1
1249	imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self or even change her you would you try to influence or try to change your younger self s beliefs in light of your future experience or perhaps the encounter would change your older self s perception of life and reality  walt disney s the kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting older self bruce willis in a collision course with younger self spenser breslin from the santa clause 2 and the cat in the hat fame the result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter which makes you ponder about your own past present and future ¬ñ and truly believe it is never too late to change your course	1
1250	truly a wonderful movie bruce willis gives her always outstanding comedic romantic acting power to this message movie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are a gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty there is more around the next bend and it can be great enriching and romantic leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future if we could re live our youthful experiences if we could really remember the events that shaped us wouldn t we find a special kind of freedom see the movie open the gift	1
1251	it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off her action throne and let us see that she really is a talented actor she shines in this film as the near 40 year old image consultant who has totally lost touch with her inner child  until she meets her face to face this is one of those rare films that doesn t talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family it is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you don t grow up exactly the way you thought you would willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness the sixth sense with haley joel osment and she has great chemistry with spencer breslin here there is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting a great film to see with every member of your family	1
1252	as a word of explanation disney s the kid has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin 1921 classic of the same name what we do have is a pleasant enough though unbelievable feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide  bruce willis in a change of pace plays a self centered stuffed shirt of an image consultant she degrades not only her clients but those close to her as well you know that she is going to have to change before the final credits  into her life comes a chapter from her past in the form of willis  character as a nerdy 8 year old played with cutesy pie conviction by spencer breslin disney always finds these kids somewhere this forces willis to come to grips with her past and wellyou know the rest  appearing as willis  love interest is emily mortimer and lily tomlin as her executive assistant both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter action between the willis and breslin characters  the kid though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling	1
1253	while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment aloud but i thought it it is a feel good mid life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after she knows her mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about   did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at 40 how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids	1
1254	now for sure this is one of the lightest hearted stories that bruce willis has been in to date and yet   it is still touching i really like bruce s style and persona i haven t loved everything she has ever been in but she brings it to the  big time  for me in most all her film endeavors the story begins she is power confidence and style with a capitol  s   she drives a porshe she lives well in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city that s russell duritz she is an image consultant to those who are on the top or rising to it her acclaim she is russell duritz she knows what it takes to make it it just seems that as life is going along swiftly and foundation ally set there is a problem an intruder at her home the alarm has been activated  russell can t seem to figure out for the moment what is happening to her it s different and yet it is somehow familiar a small boy who looks exactly like   her as their lives run smack dab into each other there seems to be a reason that is screaming out to her you have unfinished business to take care of now amy the supporting young lady of the story is probably the best balance that she has seen and has in her life she works with her puts up with her  ego  and yet she is smitten with russell very much so with rusty her past  self  now in the picture and talking a mile a minute singing too late at night everything that was foundational is becoming like jelly  willis is fun egocentric and at times out of her head in this lovable disney modern times classic  the kid  and to add her little heavy duty side kick spencer breslin is a perfect addition to this sparkling story of childhood to adult and back to childhood adventure chi mcbride is an inspirational supporting character as she is the heavy weight champ teaching  little  rusty how to box to defend herself against the bullies on the playground  all in all this is a real winner of a movie with even lillie tomlin as the secretary and aide to russell i originally saw this back in 2000  and then again years later with equal enjoyment this is a shiny family comedy that has a super ending that will warm the hearts of any disney fan recommended highly *****	1
1255	when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take after all the plot of having one s childhood self return to the present leaves open many options bruce willis however does a superb job in the role she was given i was surprised to see just how well she could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you aren t the adult you planned to be this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think usually we scorn at what if movies for example waterworld attempted to answer the question what if the world were to be covered with water and but truthfully nobody cared this movie however effects everyone in the theatre true young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children this movie is definitely worth seeing although it will be better the second time around because you won t be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff just relax and have fun and take something with you when you leave that cinema take that piece of your childhood you ve forgotten and enjoy it	1
1256	the kid   at 39 years old russel duritz has a life that most men would envy   she has a great job is respected and feared has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money but everything comes at a cost in this case no social life no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of her life alone she just needs someone to show her the way as i watched the movie i kept wondering why disney didn t pass this film on to miramax   not because it s particularly daring or edgy but because it is clearly a movie for adults this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children   it is lumped in with trailers for rugrats the movie and pokemon 2000 aren t they passe yet but i quibble i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter   rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron willis  character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of her life her guide on this journey of self discovery is herself at age 8 they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly i didn t care young rusty s innocence and unbridled optimism give her a distinct advantage in divining the truth   she sums up russell s job as an image consultant thusly you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren t in order for a good script to succeed however you need actors to bring it to life not a problem here although willis has thrice ignored wc fields  warnings about starring with children or animals she has lucked out once again meshing as well comedically with breslin as she did dramatically with osment willis manages to balance russell s cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone s childhood   the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on we also get two bonus performances lily tomlin is great as russell s levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman i loved her in guinevere the kid is charming heavy and real and it will appeal to adults of all ages	1
1257	from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values this one is definitely worthwhile this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity off color humor profanity or gratuitous violence i refer of course to the sixth sense both movies are engaging on more than one level this one is appropriate for children as well although as others have pointed out it isn t a flick for kids  i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained except that we know russell herself initiates it as a 70 year old also why does her dying mother have to come to school to get her when she wins the fight why if as her older self says she has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does her mother not have to come and get her every time and why she doesn t learn to kick butt in the process i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage  good use of the red plane as metaphor however	1
1258	the kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant russ duritz who has lots of money a good job nice house etc the only problem is she doesn t have much of a social life as nobody seems to like her as she isn t always very nice one day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of herself magically appears this gives russ a second chance to make things right bruce willis plays the lead role here and she gives a really good performance the kid is a nice heart warming movie for everyone	1
1259	this is a totally awesome movie if you haven t seen it yet you damn well should sure the plot is slow to develop the special effects are laughable the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed but as wrestler ddp would say that s not a bad thingthat s a good thing everything about this movie is hilarious especially if you get the dubbed version which has even worse actors it s countless laughs until you get to the end yearning for the sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women thus i give it ten stars unless you re one of those  discriminating  and  intelligent  people with good taste who likes only  high quality  films of the highest calibre i recommend this utterly monkeydellic movie	1
1260	what a film quite possibly the best i ve ever seen the direction the productionthe score and the cinematographyabsoloutley wonderful the acting is also excellent and the man robot scenes have to be seen to be belieived i can not recommend this film enough get it out on video now turn the lights down and enjoy	1
1261	this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray that s because it was easy to find it was on every public domain label in the vhs era and before that a late night tv cult classic double knee thigh slapper besides how do you resist the title for late comers a brief explanation of it s merit florida wheeler dealer k gordon murray imported mexican horror films dubbed them into english then made a mint with them at the drive in the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded great great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange now mix in catholic influenced social conventions mexican folk lore and we are not in kansas anymore  add to that the english scripts they were dubbed into most were written by reuban guberman who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips on screen not the literal translation as a result the american soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy there s even a fan web site for murray that prints the best most over the top lines for each movie first time viewers to the films complain about the pacing the purple prose the production values and are told it s supposed to be that waywhile the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws it all must be very confusing if you don t have a taste for it this one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series the aztec mummy and curse of the aztec mummy all three are now available on the 3 disc aztec mummy collection bci and it s about time it has the k gordon murray version on one side the original mexican production on the other side the contrast between the two is fascinating a lot of the times the original spanish is not much saner robot mummy starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes sort ofcontinuity was tossed out the window in number two and it s downhill from there logic wise you don t even get the angel back or any mention of her in this final episode names places even family trees switch between films after a while you start looking for the continuity changes  by now the series villain doc krupp is totally pig biting mad nearly drooling with dementia and still wants to steal the aztec breastplate rosita arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the aztec mummy floor show and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again the mummy isn t any happier with this then she was last time the robot actually has a production credit it was made by  viana & co sa  i mention this because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout nope this was planned  wait until you see the controller it runs from x box where were you when krupp needed you the robot looks crushed to death at the end but actually came back in two more mexican made moviesit had a fan base  all in all a funny quirky finish to a three movie series sit back and enjoy	1
1262	this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long there was an aspect of film noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged even the dialogue was good along with the acting it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught her for example saying everyone has a box which she put her personal things into also on the writer s door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight two other great movies there is a great twist in the end which i m not going to spoil for anyone who hasn t seen it even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d lloyds credit card i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it plus it only being an hour long there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant	1
1263	this film is superb it has the same low budget first film feel of  pi  and  clerks  but has the style of  memento  also by writer director christopher nolan the score sound effects photography and editing are almost  memento  prototypes and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing don t be put off by the low budget look and acting or even the short length of the film and just watch it	1
1264	saw this at the hong kong international film festival over three years ago i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a no name at the time but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival it worked well on the big screen with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood mrnolan gave a good account of its making at the end enough to put anybody off starting out as a film maker i liked it better than memento although this was perhaps due to the lower expectations and the fact that it was more of an art house movie	1
1265	i m amazed that memento which is an excellent flick is so well regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn t even appear what the hell is that to be honest   when this movie ended my knee jerk reaction was that this movie is better than memento after the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off i concluded that they are equal in their excellence i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with memento i m going to venture a guess that sadly it s because it s in black and white or because again sadlythat the characters all have british accents sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this i m telling you that if you loved memento you will love following as well brilliant	1
1266	following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood the plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology the event sequence complicates following following if you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks with the running time at 70 minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled bill is a lonely untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go what they do she is a bit too conspicuous however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed clean cut bloke named cobb cobb entangles bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly the film is an excellent first effort from the talented christoper nolan who would go on to make memento one of the most original movies of our time	1
1267	this is an excellent film but momento nolan s other big budget film is much better  i would recommend people go to see momento and then if they like that see this film the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing to conculde the film has a clever plot clever twists and turns very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing	1
1268	there are two things that i noticed in this film this is not a spoiler just a mistake in storytelling when cole takes bill to her first b&e she finds the box as soon as cole finds it she says the box everyone s got a box a minute later just before she dumps the contents on the floor she says we re actually very fortunate you don t see these often observation #2 spoiler alert i had to watch the thing three times i couldn t figure a couple of things out then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time that was a good thing because i don t know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix color me obsessive	1
1269	an excellent debut movie for the the director of batman begins comes the following a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories she writes one man she follows she decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than she bargained for using a cast of non actors and her uncle writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on her own with almost no budget and produced independently this movie is much more than you d expect for anyone who likes memento and complex twists turns shocks and messing around with time this is definitely a movie for you	1
1270	christopher nolan s first film is a  no budget  black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers which in turn leads to robbery and also violence it is very good like in her later film  memento  she doesn t present the story in a linear way instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early apparently random shots take on significance as the film progresses this style also means the twists are much more effective definitely worth seeing if you get the chance especially if you like her later work and or film noir	1
1271	brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed but this small film was where she started and it certainly showcased her talent with its striking black and white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures her later  momento  albeit in a less extreme way thematically and mechanistically the plot reminded me of david mamet s  house of games  but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious the acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class   the film has a stylised quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended but it s still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling	1
1272	great british director christopher nolan momento insomnia directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people this proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like minded man who shows her the ins and outs of breaking and entering the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution jeremy theobald plays the writer and alex haw the like minded friend both are great performances this low budget movie was shot total guerrilla style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don t have which is a clever script and creative direction an impressive debut by one of todays best directors good stuff	1
1273	if christopher nolan had made memento before following then all of the flaws in following would have been corrected in memento nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly we were able to tell when it was the past when it s current etc however nolan experimented with it a little and it just doesn t work although she had a small budget and couldn t use color which is one way memento worked it was just too hard to distinguish between time on the dvd is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order i intended to write my review after watching it so hopefully it would make more sense but of course it wasn t working you can t blame nolan for not coming up with original ideas a young man bill jeremy theobald is bored so she decides to follow random people on the street she finds one cobb alex haw that particularly interests her soon bill becomes friends with cobb and goes with her as she breaks into houses and robs them then a saucy young blond lucy russell enters and the movie becomes even weirder from there the ending of following is one of the most shocking endings i ve seen sure fight club had an amazing ending but the way that following s ending played out was amazing i felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion nolan has a thing for making good endings well maybe not i could guess insomnia s from a mile away and can really construct a great story following may not be the easiest to follow or look at but it s such a finely crafted original story with a shocker ending that you ll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again my rating 7 10 rated r for language and some violence	1
1274	a suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production features performances from no name actors that rival the top talent on the planet sadly none have persued a career  also features the the god like ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue dialogue is what carries this story which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for her books well shot very well edited even better written and amazingly well performed this movie has everything a great film needs except people who have seen it 9 10	1
1275	this is definitely nolan s most intimiteand thought provoking piece not to say that memento or insomnia are badbut they were definitely up to more hollywood standardswhile following is more of an indie flick the story is very brilliantand very well developed overallwatch this if your a fan of any of nolan s worki m sure you ll be able to appreciate it more	1
1276	chris nolan s labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish a first film is as complex as memento or the prestige though maybe a little harder to get a handle on still it smacks of originality and creative drive and has a twist as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that nolan has the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until she follows someone whose noticed her following others and has been following her in tern from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange more naturalistic and realist than nolan s later work but just as razor sharp	1
1277	following is a little known 1998 british film which was made with a budget of ¬£8000 and has a running time of 70 minutes when watching it you d never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century ¬ñ well everybody has to start somewhere i suppose the director of following as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan who directly after following would go on to direct the critically acclaimed independent film memento a few years later she would be hired by warner bros to direct the new batman series which further brought her acclaim and so on and so forth my point is everybody has to start somewhere ¬ñ even if it s not in the most astounding debut ¬ñ and christopher nolan introduces herself to the world in 1998 with following when watching it i couldn t help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut avant garde auteur david lynch s eraserhead following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense but the similarities are noticeable most notable it s shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique it s hard to describe in words but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you d find in the film noirs of old hence it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir or a neo noir overall it s an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller and the story is most appropriate to these two genres the main character is nameless and the movie s title stems from an early obsessive compulsive trait she possessed ¬ñ randomly picking out people on the street and following them sometimes even for hours on end during one of these  stalking expeditions  the main character becomes noticed by one of the people she is following and is confronted turns out that the  confronter  is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator and she introduces herself her name is cobb and she s a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow her on her burglaries from there the main character becomes swept up in cobb s world and she becomes embroiled in crime passion and violence as she gets more and more intimate with cobb following is not so much a character study but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir and emulates the respective atmosphere well as a thriller following is taut and atmospheric however as a film in general it s somewhat of a disappointment if not that then one could definitely call it underwhelming the entire film is shot in a non chronological and non linear fashion and it makes the story and film experience unique to some extent ¬ñ this style has been done so many times now it s almost commonplace technique ¬ñ and the story itself is unique to some extent however following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film and is disappointingly unspectacular the story calls for more ¬ñ more action more suspense and more thrills ¬ñ but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline and instead focuses on creating an intricate story following does succeed in doing that but without any other elements it s a film noir that doesn t quite work out it s got a sense of emptiness which isn t enormous but still noticeable nonetheless furthermore the film s shocking revelation at the end ¬ñ almost a mandatory convention in film noirs ¬ñ is one that makes us feel cheated it s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere but in relation to the story it s disappointing as it essentially makes the preceding scenes and the entire film seem like an enormous waste of time but the positives far outweigh the negatives and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film yes everybody has to start somewhere christopher nolan does it with following and she does it in a fine manner a quiet meek but fine manner it s not the most astounding movie and it isn t quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade but it s still a good film nonetheless when singling out following you find a well made taut and atmospheric thriller one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless	1
1278	given christopher nolan s string of successful films it s a no brainer for me to want to check out her filmography watch her debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made her a master filmmaker and storyteller though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn t even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative s structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy theobald who starts a habitual obsession with following random people she fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before she starts to make up her own rules and break them she meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds herself hooked with hanging out with her as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim s livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobster s moll who rejects her every advance told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don t quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through it s also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from her own experience in being burgled with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess here s an example of a successful filmmaker s humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now i ll patiently wait for christopher nolan s inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease	1
1279	an untidy man known as bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall and her typewriter for company only the man can t think of anything to write she wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go maybe this will give her some inspiration to write she begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag she follows her for a few days while in a cafe the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill and inquires why bill is following her the well dressed man says her name is cobb cobb then surprisingly informs bill that she is a burglar and even starts to take bill with her into houses to steal things although cobb insists she doesn t go into other people s homes to just steal she says she likes to let people know she has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted she puts knickers from another burglary into a man s trousers for example the film is told in flashbacks at times too the director used this technique in greater abundance in her recent feature memento bill eventually decides to cut her hair and dress in a suit on the advice of cobb she meets a blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man s hence men on a man s fingers in the blonde lady s flat these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion	1
1280	it is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists sometimes even without the 20 20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are following is one such look into the past of christopher nolan one of the great time warping story teller of today christopher nolan s style of film making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story although people might complain it relies too much on the back and forth shifting of time i still find it fascinating to see how she uses that one technique differently each time memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story telling i have ever seen discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind bender the prestige which was considerably stripped down in comparison still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven even in a jaded enterprise like the batman series did christopher nolan sprinkle some of her outstanding yarn weaving tricks breathing new life into the dark knight following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery where we see a dilettante writer who becomes a reluctant voyeur who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes and finally sees an end no one could have expected having never heard of following before i had no idea what i was to expect at every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me since the mystery angle was clear i was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next and that is where i think the film succeeds so well the film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases the film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines both of which are considered gimmicky these days following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible there doesn t seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is but you don t feel like you are being taken for a ride the lack of pretension or self aware arrogance is what makes this style of story telling work highly recommended	1
1281	christopher nolan s directorial debut is a memorable one the film was very well received and help land contracts for making  memento  and quite rightfully so  following is an exquisite example of how films should be made no fancy effects or blood dripping gorejust brilliant writing and good acting nolan manages to captivate us once again with her writing the actors all unknowns to me and i suppose most people did a good job bringing the characters to live they were all believable and that s all they need to be the film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it s very rewarding in the end the film s a little short to be a full length feature but any additional length would ve ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would ve been diminished though short the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive imo an intriguing beginning an exciting middle and a surprising end  i dare say following is almost as good as memento her best film by far the scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good this film was made with a mere $6000 but the quality is much higher than most almost all million dollar box office hits the use of b&w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience following is primarily nolan showing off her skills to the studio bosses   and what skills they arerarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in  following  even pi doesn t even come close imo though it s also very good this is a film surely not to be missed by any self respecting movie lover if you liked memento  following  is definitely for you	1
1282	even with only 6000 bucks and a cast of part time actors christopher nolan was a master nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of nolan doesn t contradict that none of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt nolan and crew our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story in all honesty i think following is nolan s best screenplay because it is the one she had the most control over it s a beautifully imagined film it takes us into a world where we don t feel limited by the constraints of budget the dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent nolan s trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you with memento and the prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but nolan doesn t try to confuse people with her prototype film we can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist this method of telling a story is both creative and engaging i am glad that nolan has had so much success with it because her films become more than what they could be with this method the pay offs in the prestige and memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format this idea has been done with moderate success before but nolan has truly made it her own the script here is nolan s finest i had some doubts about her writing abilities i all ways imagined that her brother jonathon was the writing talent but she proves me wrong with following it is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function cobb s assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible my only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn t take away anything from the story or the acting following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film making at it s finest	1
1283	christopher nolan had her goals set on following in a very narrow direction and in that direction she pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little  poverty row  movies the likes of ullmer directed back in the 40s only this time she s able to implement touches of homage  things like black and white photography a given due to the shoe string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit and casting of the actors the john doe lead the slick male counterpart and the beautiful in a gritty way femme fatale  while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible that and as well in the film noir mood nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot maybe even more so than memento where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch here the non linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like bill can go through as dark a path as cobb only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who s not really twisted and into the deeper mind games cobb is of course the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story and going into it i wasn t even sure where it would lead if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala slacker where nolan would lead her character along to one urban british person to another but the establishment of the ties of bill to cobb are done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when cobb approaches bill at the caf√© to ask what she s doing following her tells almost all we need to know about both  that and the first robbery she brings her along for what seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set up by cobb and her lady just called  the blonde  maybe a too obvious homage to noir but why carp but this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how the density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters with alex haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask her  deep  ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary and theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as she is in what she really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this russell almost makes it too easy even with a face that would send ana savage shaking her head meanwhile nolan is also on the ball with her style as a cameraman keeping nothing in that doesn t add to ambiance and suspense with the fade in fade outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression but enough to add to the  this could lead anywhere  logic of the script she follows it in hand held form as if she knows where her limitations lie and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials close ups when need be one i loved is russell s face in a small mirror and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts sometimes as mentioned the line between seeing something in  present day  and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low level criminals with mind games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way simply put this is one of the great calling cards i ve seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of nolan s other work can look forward to to discovering or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid editing and big gun firing dogs of the mainstream even in independent films it s a bright little 71 minutes	1
1284	bill jeremy theobald is an inspiring writer who hasn t gotten anything published as of yet bill also has an odd and strange habit she likes to follow people bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway metro and follows them as if she were their shadow maybe bill does this to help her in inspiring herself to write the great novel that she s been dreaming about or get an article of her get printed in a major magazine maybe it s because it fills bill s lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of her curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by her paying attention to her or her or maybe it gives bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides herself bill has a simple rule that she follows religiously when she follows someone  after you follow her or her to their home or place of work you stop  one day bill follows cobb alex haw home and instead of following her rule of stopping she still keeps following cobb bill will soon realize how right she was with that rule she set for herself in following people and at the same time how wrong she was by breaking it  amazingly good low budget movie made by christopher noland in 1998 before she hit it big in hollywood with her ground breaking and original motion picture classic momento some two years later that has already become a major cult movie  following is actually a much better movie then momento because it s a conventional and easy to follow story compared to momento s which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it s backward storyline very complicated whats makes following so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it s affect on those who watch it the movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don t have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like momento did following is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending if you watch the movie again and notice the clues that you ll ever see made with an unbelievably small budget of $600000 thats less then what most hollywood movies budgets out for coffee breaks with a no name cast in black and white and just over one hour 71 minutes long hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of hollywood can learn a lot from chris noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can t make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars	1
1285	just watched this on dvd three times   once the  normal  way once with the scenes in consecutive order in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine and once with the director s commentary running quite amazing a bare bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big budget overblown features being released today  i think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent memento which turned me on to nolan in the first place can t wait to see what she does with a bigger budget and bigger box office stars in her next film insomnia	1
1286	great film no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films everything supported the suspense of the plot b&w gave it a basic no frills feel also in short it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast following serves as an interesting contrast to memento characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively in that sense both reminded me somewhat of in the company of men also highly recommendable one difference between nolan s two films is that memento was a little easier for me to follow given that the b&w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction and so do those in color i don t think that was true of following where scenes seemed to be shown at random if you have the choice between vcr and dvd i d highly recommend dvd since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order not just in the scrambled albeit ingenuous order presented by nolan it also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want to as another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and memento is that none of the cast were famous they were characters not big name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies given certain similarities in the plots i wonder if memento is sort of a remake of following but intended to reach a bigger audience like edward burns made she s the one in the mold of    and with largely the same cast as    the brothers mcmullan	1
1287	i just finished watching following and i thought it was great i rated it 8 out of 10 i plan on watching it again with the director s commentary and then again in chronological order i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan s more recent movie memento following has some similarities this movie was probably the blueprint for memento even the music in some parts is very similar shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel the story and dialogue is really good the performance of the actors is believable christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget i look forward to her next release insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino	1
1288	the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldn t have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply her trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audience s and protagonist s expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial set up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography she often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times one can easily see nolan s style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans	1
1289	christopher nolan s first directorial effort a year before she did memento and this is almost as brilliant as that classic she uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell her story and it s a very clever one bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they re all about one day she follows this man cobb who turns the tables and confronts bill who breaks down and confesses what she s up to  cobb is a burglar and she takes bill along on a few jobs to teach her the ropes both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them  but there s an ulterior motive for cobb nurturing this relationship and it all ties in very smartly at the end no i won t spoil it but this is a very cool movie and i m beginning to think christopher nolan is a genius if you like suspense films with surprise endings this one is a must see	1
1290	christopher nolan s first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out shot on a micro budget of $6000 this is a student film with real class the film is shot in black and white and features people who you assume are friends of nolan s appearing in the movie this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good you could see jeremy theobald and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven t since this was made 6 years ago nolan s thriller much like memento does not play chronologically it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction the writing is fantastic it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all this is so good it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films this the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia has cemented herself as the most exciting new talent of recent times i can t wait for batman this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it she has gone on to compose nolan s other films  overall i would recommend this i intend to get all of nolan s films this is a low budget gem ***** 	1
1291	you were on your way up and you tripped on a skirt  gilligan says to jim leonard that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard a young humphrey bogart when her dream gets sidetracked by the bombshell heiress carol played by dorothy mackaill leonard has been working on a new and improved motor but now her love life and motor company both have their ups and downs in this 68 minute shortie bogart hadn t developed the quiet brooding style yet good performances by most of the supporting characters   her butler her co workers a sister interlopers along the way some adult themes since it was done just before they really enforced the film code but it s still tame compared to what is on tv today directed by thornton freeland a year before freeland directed the incredible flying down to rio	1
1292	humphrey bogart in her first starring role looks very young acts well but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in her career still she s very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor dorothy mackaill is the real star here playing a once rich woman who s torn between her real love for bogart she s broke too and the comfort and security of marrying an older man hale hamilton along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart s trampy sister bradley page as her would be producer barbara leonard as the cosmetologist jack kennedy as gilligan and halliwell hobbes as the faithful and wise butler both mackaill whi had been a star in silent films and bogart were trying to gain a toehold in talkies in 1932 bogart was a slow rising actor from the broadway stage mackaill was slipping and would soon appear in skid row production like picture brides yet they are both very good here mackaill wasn t even 30 when she appeared in this film	1
1293	i saw this episode of masterpiece theatre and immediately came to imdb to look it up i was greeted by a comment from another user who believed that it was nothing special a 6 out of 10 and underwhelming i would feel morally remiss if i didn t disagree now i am an avid fan of masterpiece theatre but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television for example she knew she was right was absolutely horrendous carrie s war however is probably the best i ve seen so far the entire cast does an excellent job and it held my interest more than any other piece i ve seen recently the character mr evans is of particular interest and through subtle images of for example an untouched birthday cake or a garnet ring my opinion of her went from bad to truly good truly her ultimate demise and the story of how everyone around her left her a cold hard man is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me the end is gratifying in every sense but one that everyone did not get what they deserved but overall things worked out i absolutely recommend this to everyone	1
1294	a delightful story about two evacuees has been turned into a nice little film by the bbc most children who like a good story will enjoy this the characters are played really well by a very good cast not sure whether our american friends will appreciate it but they do get a mention as aunty lou runs off with a gorgeous american soldier	1
1295	having seen other bollywood flicks with salman khan in them i can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones the songs are all quite fun especially  o priya o priya  which seems to have a nice mix of beatles indian music and dare i say this a bit of prince the love stories are a bit more believable than say chal mere bhai the occasional focus on prem s use of alcohol is at times troubling as it doesn t really seem to make sense to me but it s played well by khan  although her voice does become squeaky when she s portraying drunkenness	1
1296	kahin pyaar na ho jaaye is a great family movie salman khan is looking handsome and great than ever there s even a scene where she takes off her shirt what a surprise rani mukherjee is great too pooja batra had very few lines to say but i m glad she has been acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential it s about prem salman khan and she is a wedding singer she is about to marry nisha raveena tandon but gets stood up prem goes to nisha s house and asks her why she was ditched and it s because her brother is ill and she needs to marry an nri rahul inder kumar to get the money to get her treated prem moves on and in comes priya rani mukherjee prem falls in love with priya but it s a shame she s about to get married to an nri who could this nri be priya falls in love with prem too while rahul is there with her prem gives priya an insulting comment one day and she goes off and sets off to agra for the wedding with rahul will prem stop her watch kpnhj to find out the film was very funny the songs were great especially the song o priya o priya it s a shame the film flopped in india and i don t know why every film in india is going flop nowadays this film deserved to be a hit the only problem i found with the film is that they had an obsession about nri s they think all nri s are rich the film deserves a 9 10	1
1297	this movie was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war  most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nation  a patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramatically  a definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the over the top acting you often saw in other films of the day one annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time	1
1298	i really liked this movie one thing i have noticed is that korean tv drama s are way better as far as giving you the whole story i watch movies when i do not have the time or feel like going through 16 30 episodes movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully you may miss something  i do feel this one was rushed and i had to rewind a few parts to try and find what i missed especially towards at the end if you like nice love stories i still think this is cute and if yo have the extra time i still think this is worth watching it is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries	1
1299	i was geared up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to allay my fears it starts off with 2 high school gangs squaring off against each other with bad kung fu a scenario found in countless other korean films ho hum add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote she was cool which was barely passable and well i thought i was in for a nondescript 2 hours but don t give up so quickly a romance of their own was directed by tae gyun kim who also did volcano high which i thought was loads of fun anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better a high school girl just having moved to seoul finds herself in the middle of attention from two prospective suitors each guy has her own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pick what follows is not your usual teen love triangle the emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make them the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience who does one choose at what point is one obligated to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems she is being strung along after you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how *should* you react when new information comes up that sheds new light on the situation there is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a real life reaction instead of over the top movie reaction the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene recent events and revelations have left her confused and emotionally overwhelmed basically she doesn t know what to make of things instead of having her act out something or look all gape mouthed dumbstruck she just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all it s like someone just pulled the plug on her her reaction rang true to me and i appreciated the scene like most korean films there is a mix of action bravado slapstick and melodrama korean films often take abrupt turns see sex is zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the uninitiated go ahead and initiate yourself with this one like it love it or hate it i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters  actions and reactions	1
1300	let s face it this movie is incredibly clich√© as korean romance dramas and movies go first of all there s a pair of long lost siblings one of which falls in love with the other second there s a not so popular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes her life still i like this movie without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel but because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossing  i honestly couldn t stop watching kang dong won despite her pretty face gives an awesome heartrending performance not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun plus all the supporting actors i d definitely recommend this movie to everyone	1
1301	i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good and i watched a video on it so i was really into watching it i watched it and damn the fighting scenes are really good if the guys can t fight like that in real life they sure fooled me there isn t as much fighting as i would like i have to say but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular they don t show much but you can tell it s violent and cool but there s also the plot that goes around a love triangle between the main characters though it s a bit twisted tae sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fights she s the leader of her school and is the rival of hea won who s the leader of her own school   a bit of a playboy hot headed and a rich boy then there s han kyung a girl with not a lot going for her   her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother the guy she liked is dating her old friend   and then she meets hea won who goes to her school and tae sung who calls her nuna older sister eventually she discovers tae sung is her brother fruit of one of her father s affair and she loves her despite of their blood relation meanwhile hea won falls for her and takes her as her boyfriend but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother who confesses her love to her overall it s a wonderful movie but if i was really depressed after the end and i just couldn t help but think damn are all korean movie i watch about fighting death depressing stuff incest  cause that sure was the case with old boy and temptation of wolves it s a very good movie but people have to be ready to cry at the end	1
1302	it s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich√© you cant help but like it i think the story was a little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friend it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good	1
1303	glorifying not glamorizing world war ii we ve had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it s own there was crusade in europewhich was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33rd president of the united states of america dwight d eisenhower it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander then there was a crusade in the pacificsubject matter self explanatorywhich i don t remember much about newspaper man author jim bishop was the host navigator of battleline and there was the excellent winston churchill the valiant years* the series was a co production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company it first aired in 1960 61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton s speaking the words of sir winston it is the 1952 nbc television network s production of our subject matter today this victory at sea that wins the cigar hands down to begin with this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states independent newsreel film motion picture record of our other allied partner nationsas well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan once that was accomplished the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1 2 hour installments this was done with great skill being that there were so many scene changes whether done abruptly or as a dissolve the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action rather than exaggerating it the narration goes to mr ralph graves who was a talented actor of stage film radio and television she certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of her golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions lastly victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score both opening theme and incidental music penned by richard rodgers of broadway famerodgers & hart rodgers & hammerstein her compositions are intricate full variable and even classic in the true sense the classical arrangement was played by the nbc sympphony orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record cassette tape compact disk it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release 55 years ago and really small wonder for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer listener it truly puts the frosting on this cake * sir winston churchill the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score this also was composed by mr rodgers ** we had in additional ace in the hole in our house in the person of our father the late clement j ryan1914 74 dad had been in the usnavy during the war being inducted in 1943 or 44 our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series she and our mother the now 90 year old bertha nee fuerstryan already had my older sister joanne1942 90as a dependant	1
1304	i just found the entire 3 dvd set at wal mart in the bargain bin for $550 so i thought i would take another look total of 13 hours to watch it all 26 episodes i was born in 1948 and saw most of them on tv in the sixties many independent stations repeated them for many years better than i expected actually time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it s creators and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the allied fighting men and women more abstract and arty than a straight forward documentary but very truthful in it s depiction of the causes and final results of wwii that war was greatly dependent on sea transportation and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world s oceans the allies were the ones who were able to do it interesting too to see how they try to strike a balance between big events and the individual soldiers and sailors that made them happen the score is impressive if a bit too much by today s standards i read somewhere that robert russell bennett contributed just as much as richard rodgers to final score i imagine that rodgers provided all the major themes and it was up to bennett to fit them to the images great job should be seen by every ruler or potential ruler a warning to tyrants that wars are eventually won by ideals determination and the supplies to back them up logistics their quality and delivery will determine the eventual victors the allies outproduced and surpassed the material quality of the axis attacked their very source in the process and insured their eventual defeat sorry to see that the producer henry salomon lived a very short life imdb s facts were rather skimpy i have to find out more about her she did a few more outstanding documentaries before her early death might have more to say at a later time trivia i had all 3 lp records made of the background music pretty good overall unfortunately the producers decided to add sound effects to the last one relegating immediately to just novelty status rather than for serious music listening too bad too because it contained some interesting but more minor themes in the series silly stuff like 16 inch guns firing torpedoes being fired bulldozers planesjust for kids mainly rsgre	1
1305	i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday and it seemed like a bit of silly fun and sure enough the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words   but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids and their parents too 10 year old ricky bernard jordan garrett has her head in the clouds most of the time much to her father s larry miller dismay as a member of her school orchestra ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance  and once again ricky s mind  takes off  and suspects some criminal plot is happening reluctantly aided by best friend sashi who is a fan of hot sauce what a strange plot device that was and others they try to get to solve the mystery oh yes and ricky s skills 1000 hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when she is called on to save the day in the film s thrilling climax it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part i totally liked junior pilot charming and good natured performances funny plot line and a real sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness if you are looking for an entertaining family film you could do far worse than buy this one	1
1306	definitely worth renting good clean family entertainment my 4 and 5 year olds and i loved it kept them on the edge of their seats i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this as it can be quite suspenseful for them it s not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children and so this is a rare find some of the acting   realism isn t quite there at times or maybe is a little corny but children don t seem to notice or care they love it parts are predictable but other parts are not   like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are the movie doesn t have any really scary creepy stuff and so i doubt it will give children nightmares it does inspire children to dream which is something we need to encourage and foster more in our children rent and be blessed	1
1307	this was a great movie it had one sot so nice outburst plus there were some very intense drama scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers under 6 for a under the radar film the acting was quite enjoyable and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing it held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end this movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day but was given a somewhat more believable scenario the dream scenes were a distraction at first but did a great deal to establish the plot the pranks and hi jinx were also quite amusing we hope you like as much as we did	1
1308	this film is titled junior pilot here on imdb but final approach at netflix go figure the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth for the adult the story is quite predictable and perhaps trite and melodramatic whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line in any case credit must be given to the film s creators particularly the director james becket and the cinematographer denis maloney for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film the cut aways to the young protagonist ricky s fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed the young actors give uniformly believable performances seemingly quite invested in their roles  silly as many scenes are jordan garrett plays the protagonist ricky with quite well having excellent camera presence jeffrey tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive shashi who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce skyler samuels and adam cagley give solid performances as well as is typical of her always fine acting larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children s part real part fantasy world revolves compared to her father figure the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one dimensional intentionally and quite humorously so to be sure this movie is a simplistic youth targeted story of course yet it is quite entertaining perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once youthful perspective	1
1309	i ve just watched this with my three children   12yrs boy 10yrs boy and 8yrs girl and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure although definitely aimed at the kid market i d say 5 to 13it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch   particularly younger children the story revolves around ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in her daydream sequences who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on on board a flight to washington for a school trip ricky s dad is an airplane mechanic so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top gun on her computer flight simulator this comes in handy when the pilot and co pilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane i don t want to give away any more of the plot	1
1310	i never heard of mishima before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box at the beginning of the film we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public as the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of mishima s mind the stages of her life are are presented in four chapters each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives the first continues the story with scenes from mishima s life and appear in black and white the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours there is a different novel staged in each chapter between each chapter the narrative returns to the present as mishima proceeds towards her eventual ritual suicide this means that the drama and tension is maintained until the end i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art house i respect that this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line if on the other hand you are the kind of person who relishes the opportunity to penetrate the mind a bizarre man while watching her life story told in collage of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass you will love it i loved it 	1
1311	i saw this originally on channel 4 uk and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me however i saw it on irish tv recently and there was an added narration by roy scheider we re going to need a bigger boat this ruined the film for me her droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film and if anything takes from the films brilliance i wonder at the new dvd version that has no roy due to legal reasons would stop people from buying it well believe me the film is much better for it cheers damian	1
1312	this movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet mishima it jumps around through her past through her last day and through some of her stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section it captures the flavor of the man her work and of her timesthe difficult 1960s i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from her works the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective they could be used as exemplars for any set designer i woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda  the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history	1
1313	mishima a life in four chapters is an art house biography about yukio mishima celebrated japanese writer who bears resemblance to paul schrader s earlier character travis bickle taxi driver both of them are lonely people searching for their place in their society and when they realize that world doesn t need them they try to destroy their surrounding universe if you want to learn about life of mishima then you won t find a lot of information here because it shows that she didn t live a very interesting life except for her final day but if you want to understand her personality then it is the best movie of its kind as most of the movie is adaptation of her novels and also provides a guide to her thoughts this movie shows that mishima was a person who witnessed the fall of japanese culture which she was very fond of and with her final act she tried to save traditions and prove to herself that she is a real warrior but she realized that as a person she was just a man with no power to change the events	1
1314	paul schrader and her brother leonard wrote mishima and in so doing clearly drew parallels between the life of yukio mishima and her work the film is divided into four sections beauty art action and the fateful day when mishima held an army general hostage and spoke to the garrison only to have it ridicule her and her bushido ideals of the samurai code mishima committed ritual seppuku on november 25 1970 and she planned it as a meshing of beauty art and action schrader edits scenes recreating that day with three different scenarios from mishima s novels temple of the golden pavilion kyoko s house and runaway horses the moment of seppuku is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously zooming in  black and white sequences are intermingled with the colorful moments depicted in mishima s novels the black and white scenes represent memories from mishima s childhood and youth schrader correlates some of these autobiographical moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel mishima s real life such as her stammer development of her bodybuilding obsession and her fostering of the samurai code each of the three themes of beauty art and action is exemplified in the chosen depictions from the respective novels the color sequences are reminiscent of early stagy technicolor films giving the film perhaps an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter ken ogata plays the real mishima with unfailing determination headed to the general s office on that fateful day and resembles the real mishima schrader took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels she did and with tying them thematically to both mishima s personal life and her literary ambitions the editing of the film between the three main sections of november 25 1970 the black and white growing up segments and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate intersection of these elements of beauty art and action in mishima s life at times it is difficult to follow and there may be little to recommend for the uninitiated viewer *** of 4 stars	1
1315	this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art this is an oblivious labour of love by the schrader brothers about the life of yukio mishima that is full truly artistic elements the movie jumps from color to black and white past to present fictional works by mishima to her all without being confusing in the least bit the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie with the exception of the narrator s spoken parts is in japanese still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn t found won criterion if you are reading this this is a film that should be released under your imprint with as much extras as possible this film truley deserves more 10 10	1
1316	mishima a life in four chapters is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease it is based on the life of controversial japanese author yukio mishima who committed suicide in the 1970s it is not really a biopic   at least not one in the traditional sense   but an exploration of mishima s iconoclastic oeuvre the film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered totally engaging manner paul schrader makes you sympathize with mishima without having to deconstruct her or her work it doesn t quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it an added bonus as we see mishima s fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema john bailey s cinematography is spectacularly good the grandiosity of composer philip glass  work is perfectly suited for the project mishima is the best film i ve seen this year so far	1
1317	mishima   a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day mesmorizing cinematography accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan s greatest novelists whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture as any gifted character mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being the conflict between the pen and a sword as the director puts it in her final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima herself all schrader s films and the ones she wrote scripts for are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn t belong in an environment she lives in that also goes for mishima who apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words her demise consisted of both of these key points in her life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty 20 out of 10	1
1318	the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives her life just before she and four members of her private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicideshown in color flashbacksshown in black and white and scenes from her novelsshown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow fusing of mishima s life with her fictions until the endor the beginning when like the ancient samurai she so admires she will be at a balance of pen and sword when her words and actions are the same and she is a full and pure being paul schrader wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat peoplea bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in mishima she comes closest to making a really excellent film whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates her tuberculosis to get of of ww2 of which she seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed a sexual media phenomena all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short stories a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than herself that she was always missing watching her with her fellow suicidal cadets you see her happy delivering her big paternal speech giving orders and loving the controluntil the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable  though the story fascinating at times really isn t this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editingmusicby philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional bio pic one day i will pick up a mishima book she does seem to have an ear for prose and for staging ideas but for now i m satisfied with the film those interested in japanese literature and post war culture should check out fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should enjoy as well	1
1319	this is my favourite film and i think it is perfect unlike virtually any other film i can name i never watch this film and think it would have been better if they d changed this or that or whatever is this the definition of a work of art i think so every brushstroke in mishima is perfect and it all flows from the schrader s script i ve always sort of liked paul schrader s work you can t argue with taxi driver and light sleeper is an amazing film but while her writing often seems to border on the bombastic her directing style is usually non existent this is deliberate i think because her films usually deal with a search for redemption and are set in the real world ugly and harsh her style suits her themes as she presents her characters in a simple and realistic way and lets them show the audience the truth of the situation imagine if schrader had directed taxi driver or bringing out the dead instead of scorsese but like the protagonists of those two films while mishima the man was ideal schrader material right wing vain and at odds with society her works were subtle and beautiful in fact she had a secondary writing career as a woman s writer churning out what can reasonably be described as romantic potboilers so you wouldn t necessarily imagine that schrader was the ideal man to capture that subtlety and beauty on film i think the film shows that she was the script she helped fashion splits mishima the man into three parts her life her death and her mind her life is represented in black and white still camera formal compositions her death for which she will always be best remembered is handheld documentary style and her mind is represented by the dramatised extracts from her novels each one revealing the thought processes of this complex man who hardly ever wrote a character that wasn t a reflection of herself these dramatisations are beautiful to look at thanks to eiko ishioka s remarkable production design and schrader s imaginative staging in all parts the acting is superb especially from ken ogata as mishima who captures the essential charm arrogance and narcissism of the man the photography is excellent throughout and contains images that the viewer will retain forever finally the music is simply superb perfectly matching the images although written and recorded before shooting adjusted during the editorial process and then re recorded how much the music influenced the shoot i do not know but it bonds perfectly to the image i have seen many ideas of what various people think the theme of the film is what schrader is trying to say you know the big stuff about life death etc but i do not think the film is saying anything mishima has already said it the film simply repeats	1
1320	there are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as mishima a life in four chapters one of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film this film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy but it also flows through some of yukio mishima greatest stories this film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch not to mention the incredible philip glass soundtrack	1
1321	movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever mishima falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author s stories into a look at her past and final day on earth the day she tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor failing to do that she commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led her to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays ken ogata is magnificent as mishima despite her eccentricities she comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for her beliefs and does this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful of the three story adaptations temple of the golden pavilion kyoko s house and runaway horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional it also is the story that most closely matches mishima s mood in her final years and illustrates what truly led her to the events of november 1970 this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass  striking musical score not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it s visuals paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears mishima a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant	1
1322	it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film initially i was struck by the stylized sets but found the rest slow going and dull i thought that such a sensational subject needed the ken russell treatment to take it way over the top i now find the enforced restraint placed on the production by mishima s widow to be an asset some of the more lurid aspects of mishima s life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from her novels i think it helps to be familiar with the novels   that s what finally made the difference for me still feel the film overall could be a little tighter and warmer but it s genuinely unique and deserves serious attention love the fact that the japanese characters speak japanese   not english the philip glass score is mesmerizing	1
1323	mishima is one of the greatest films ever made now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but i don t really like the films she s directed of what i ve seen with the exception of this and affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3 dimensional character study it follows the life of yukio mishima japan s most celebrated writer combining the last day of her life with flashbacks and her stories i don t know how but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing truly an underrated gem of a film	1
1324	one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb & complex while it is not a literal biography schrader & her co screenwriter leonard scharder her brother have taken several incidents from her life including her sucide and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning mishima s homosexuality is almost not there due to legal threats from her widow but in spite of this the film is still terrific and one of the best films i saw in 1985 i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score which adds an additional texture to the film and is superior to the one she did for scorsese s kundun also notable is john bailey s fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola s dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd	1
1325	the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate ie ground air helicopters and jets as a team that s the season i give the high rating to true there are still a lot of liberties taken in season 1 but the stories were more believable the subsequent seasons were a gawd awful attempt of melrose place meets top gun  i was a marine stationed at miramar at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolin rowland s character was good to go brolin s character was good in the first season only for some reason she slacked off after the first ep of the second season if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates then season one is the one to watch if you re into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun then see the last two seasons	1
1326	i would just like to point out in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining these days with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas reality shows etc it s nice to get lost in a good cheesy show with entertaining characters pwog fits the bill was it emmy material no but it was awesome just the same i also have to put a vote in for the second cast   they were more charismatic than the cast of season one i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast even though the series has been off the air for years i ll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase	1
1327	i heard that after the first oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill i believe that this is not the caseat least not for this film this movie is even better than the first film the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry benedict s casinos now benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks to do that they must do a couple heists in europe to get the money the acting is very good the all star cast exceeded expectations matt damon brad pitt and catherine zeta jones were probably the best in this film there are some confusing moments in this film but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun overall this is a great heist movie i rate this movie 9 10	1
1328	ocean s twelve is probably better than ocean s eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from benedictandy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around ocean s twelve is more entertaining and cooler than ocean s eleven with a funny cameo by topher grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think ocean s twelve is probably the best in the series the plot a year or so after ocean s twelve terry benedictthe guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if ocean s eleven doesn t pay her back the money they stole she s going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets her old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets her again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are with many funny scenes like when tessjulia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts ocean s twelve is a pretty clever film it s cooler funnier and more entertaining than ocean s eleven	1
1329	ocean s 12  if you steal fifty million dollars they will find you  alan rickman as hans gruber die hard this adage certainly rings true in this sequel terry benedict has been informed that danny ocean and her compadres were the ones who ripped her off and now she wants it all back the ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but cannot work in the states as benedict has made it impossible for them so it s off to europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid catherine zeta jones  super cop an old flame from rusty s pitt s past  on their first heist in amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the  night fox  a super slick thief with a legend complex she issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of uma thurman kill bill ii buried alive type sequence interesting well yes slow sort of entertaining mostly unnecessary scenes of character development plenty  ocean and her band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more  pally  situations and conversations too many damon s linus is more nervous than before the cousins are bickering as we knew they would bernie mac talks too much and don cheadle s cock er ney accent is as bad as ever i really like cheadle but could not abide this pitt and clooney talk like old friends filling each other s glasses and reading each other s minds however what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was and as much as these actors work well together zeta jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole she simply doesn t fit and her chemistry with pitt is non existent the stars of this film for me however were vincent cassel as the night fox and soderbergh s choice of locations cassel plays pomp and wealth as if she was born into both her night fox is arrogant  awfully cavalier with other people s lives  danny ocean and a total contrast to the ocean gang this is where i think the film loses its way cassel and the european locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the american actors and the style of the first film we want slick brash and quick witted not gritty considered and intellectual this is where the film doesn t work admittingly you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this	1
1330	with a cast like this i knew the acting would be amazing still i was cautious as i always am of sequels would it sustain the feeling of the first film could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of ocean s 11 we ll never know because they didn t try at least not in the way i expected instead they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre if you want a gripping logical heist don t watch this if you want a good laugh with witty dialogue quirky characters and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to impersonate herself then you ll love ocean s 12	1
1331	film certainly can be a narrative medium but by no means is it the ideal medium literature best carries a plot because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is a series of images grouped together what soderbergh does in ocean s twelve is combine impeccable film making technique with the free flowing form of american movies from the 1970s from looking at the comments posted recently most people went in expecting a standard issue heist movie a la entrapment it seems people actually miss the tiresome clich√©s of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake soderbergh s directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie but close ups of pitt and zeta jones forty feet high on the screen don t hurt either a true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it s not	1
1332	soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing she could conjure could beat the amazing cast she gathered for this zenith of sequels clearly she knew this from the get go the term star vehicle has traditionally been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even brighter than before the last scene says it all  all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them socialize as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zeta jones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the story s not important at all  at least that s not where the films  greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with 11 but if star gazing turns you on this will make your day	1
1333	i felt cheated out of knowing the whole story while there could be a twist this twist was so significant that i felt betrayed i believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better the writer could have revealed more of the  twists  throughout the movie rather than all at once at the end that aside i believe that the actors did very well with what they had particularly matt damon who actually had a little character in her character little quirks that weren t egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what she is doing the other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with one another the cohesiveness of the group in ocean s eleven was gone	1
1334	despite what its critics ensue i enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before won oscars is at the top of her game ocean s 12 is light commercial fluffy steve s day at the midway if you will i am generally not a fan of zeta jones but even i must admit that kate is stunning in this movie it s ending screams of an upcoming trequel and i will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of george and brad and matt parlay through clooney s digs in lago di como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again if we tolerated 3 installments of the lord of the rings i ask if we can drool over clooney s salt and pepper lid just one more time	1
1335	strike force or the librarians is a fun action movie that doesn t it take itself too seriously william forsythe stars as simon who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client she meets up with sandi erika eleniak who is also looking for someone her sister but there are evil bad guys afoot the most evil of them all is marcos canarious andrew divoff marcos likes to kill people so now simon and sandi have to team up to bring down the villains the whole cast is great with divoff stealing the movie there are also cameos by ed lauter and burt reynolds if you are looking for a good action film watch this and have a good time	1
1336	i just called my brother paulie on the phone and she said she was watching hoods and it was funny so like i said never go against the family the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently if something is misspelled it s most likely my eyesight and not my brain this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at the departed when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge that usually means it wasn t all that suspenseful all you need is a good directerthe same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie goodfellows but in a completely different wayand then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar easy as pie i have to see hoods to make sure it wasn t better than the departed gibbs	1
1337	hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie although i haven t seen dahmer 2002 i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind i loved this movie just brace yourself for low budget and no blood its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and her actions and thoughts from childhood up through her arrest my favorite line is  if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives enjoy	1
1338	this film is the most traumatising and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmercarl crew brutally murder her victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a psycotic maniac as she was so selfishly inwardly emotional her emotions and selfishness went so far deep into her brain that it resulted into her becoming a murderer every person that she lured back to her apartment she was attracted to and had feelings for and the reasons why she murdered them wasn t only for the thrill of killing them but because she couldn t cope with the fact of them leaving her in the scene when she killed her first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn t because she wanted to kill her but because she was devastated with the idea of the guy leaving her it was from thereafter that she got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing her hobby   for both evil and emotional reasons the scene when she was talking while crying on the phone with her mother and telling her how much she loved her and the love she showed to her grandmother and how she didn t want to move out of her house did show that she did have love in her heart one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest overheard jeffrey in a pub inviting a guy back to her apartment and then phoned jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change her mind on going home with jeffrey when the guy left the pub the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer her evil and cold blooded facial expressions before she massacred her victims were so real i was shivering in my seat her facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent d onofrio private pyle leonard in the film  full metal jacket  looked just before she gunned down the general in the toilet barracks if your an emotional person i wouldn t recommend you to watch this film but if your not than go ahead and watch it	1
1339	this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account let s filter the more judgmentalok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you withstand an independent low budget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of dahmer s adult life and subsequent murder spree and is styled as an autobiography it isn t a glamorized unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid her apartment her thoughts of what got her there are presented to us in a past tense narrated style that accurately explains much of dahmer s psychoses and motives which led her to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the devious side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isn t anyone s fault but dahmer s that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just her animalistic side represented truthfully in this film you see her having a loving relationship with her grandmother as well as trying to find companionship but of course we witness the side of her that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual onscreen violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as spattering of blood or a body being struck through a blurred curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty bloodless throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you don t see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and her victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual onscreen mutilation is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to disturb the viewer and doesn t look to be exploitive besides these fake anatomical pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like fakes to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before dahmer s death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior that s about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as i ve stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but it s not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of america s most remembered serial killers i think it s safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for overcoming its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer	1
1340	this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid it had it all  music stories a talking squirrel and chuckling daisies i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing i m 35 and i grew up in south jersey but we got three new york channels with our cable hook up and i think it was on channel 11 they just don t make shows like this anymore i know that makes me sound really old and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv but i could always find something cool to watch i ve only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show she s three years younger than me and she grew up in north jersey i would love to see this series on dvd so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter and she could see what silly but great stuff her mom used to watch i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes and a music cd from the show on ebay and i bought them right up even though they were a little pricey i can t wait to get them to re live the great memories	1
1341	when i was five years old it was my favorite television show i remembered it was on channel 11 at 2pm everyday the show s premise was simple with carole and janis as the hostesses of this children s television show they sang songs and read stories to us as children it was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re broadcasted over and over i remember sherlock the puppet in the tree the show taught us how to count add subtract and the alphabet for thirty minutes a day now i learned something new with paula and janis i remember those days as pleasant memories and now i hope the children of today can learn to love simpler things like hearing stories inexpensive props riding the swings and talking to puppets the set was ideal and simple but it was carole and janis who made it worth while while i miss my childhood and those days where the most important thing was watching the magic garden life seemed so much simpler and better now i hope the kids today enjoy the show	1
1342	i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four years old i had half day kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child i of course stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out no vcr s or dvr s back then i grew up not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade  i also had no idea that there are dvd s and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show but now they re all past the demographic or i d buy all of them dvd sets this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today	1
1343	one of the best memories of my childhood should be on dvd it captured everything we grew up with in the seventies   peace mellowness flower power and great acoustic music the two hosts carol and paula were the definitive peacenik hippies with long hair peasant blouses and bell bottomsthey looked like a katherine rossala the graduate and ali mcgrawala love storyrespectively they made us happy with jokes from the daisy chucklepatch gave us lessons on being nice through conversations with the crotchedy garden squirrel and entertained us with music from their guitar they were the best and carol was also the original sandy in the original production of greasecool this show should be in a time capsule from the era that would also include the yellow submarine arrow to the sun and marlo thomas  free to beyou & me also sunshine and the point and last but not least that theme song see ya see ya hope you had a good good time ah ha glad we got to say good mornin  to ya  hope we get get to see ya again see ya see ya glad that you could stay awhile ah ha hope we get see ya again see ya see ya	1
1344	it s hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends i have a bunch of shasta daisy s in the back yard which i lovingly call my chuckle patch my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch where kids tv today is compiled of violent cartoons characters who do magic or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values i will hold fond memories of carole and paula and the chuckle patch	1
1345	ohmygawd the magic garden is perhaps one of my most vivid  70s childhood memories two hippie chicks with ponytails carole and paula would swing on swings tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called the storybox and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named sherlock that lived in one of their trees they also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody this was a great childhood show very 70s feeling but that s the problem they don t make shows like this anymore pity that you could tell these two girls really had hearts of gold and loved kids they were really sweet magic garden is one of those shows that if they came out with a box set people would buy it because its such a mellow walk down memory lane	1
1346	i saw this last night in fort lauderdale in general it was funny and i liked the characters especially sabrina the acting is good and the story line was ok except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like what i wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better the film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout it has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for ash christian i thought it was good you might want to wait for the dvd on this one but if you get a chance to see it give it a shot	1
1347	my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for agliff a film festival this movie was one of the best i ve seen this year it was a great comedy   very original and heartfelt   and funny as hell everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie texas is a big state   with lots of small towns   and of course plenty of teenagers who grew up as fat girls i know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level ashley fink and robin de jesus were awesome   they were so great in these rolls it was like the script was written with them in mind and speaking of the script it was very well written very believable and ash is a great actor her facial expressions alone made me giggle it is an independent film   but don t let that fool youit s a good one seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring	1
1348	i caught this film at an outfest screening in los angeles in july 2006 it s rough around the edges sound recording in particular is wobbly and often very funny the script is rather jarringly episodic and ends abruptly but ash christian infuses the film with lots of genuine heart it s also a refreshing change of pace to have a gay film that doesn t star underwear models obsessed with partying and chasing straight guys props to a warmly sympathetic jonathan caouette as mr cox a kindred spirit to rodney ash christian the lively and spirited ashley finke as rodney s best friend and deborah theaker as rodney s mom who is given the best one liners in the script and steals her every scene the film is like its writer director star¬ólumpy and a bit odd but also very sweet	1
1349	this is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre it makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc  the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand it s somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing if this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director  it s actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself	1
1350	i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn t expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect her ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see she could have turned this character into something we ve all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again i didn t know what she would do after tarnation ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angus napoleon dynamite but it s something more than that it s a character study into what it s like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon	1
1351	a good entertainment but nothing more  in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but it s always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with her legendary flegma although she isn t as fit as in the forties or the fifties and don t forget david carradine is the son of john carradine	1
1352	burt kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel kennedy was a well known good writer & director mostly westerns robert mitchum was a star for over 20 years when she made this this role was like many she had made alreadyone can see why she was a big star for so many years she filled this role easily like a well used glove the title character is played by robert walker jr her father a fine actor robert walker  died tragically at age 32   her mother is noted actress jennifer jones robert was of slight build & even though she had talent only made a few films she was in rita hayworth s near last film road to salinas    the same year & was very good she looked very much like her father but seemed to lack her fathers charm she made only a few more movies she is still living & i wish her well most of her scenes are with another son of a hollywood great john carradine s son david who is still making movies they made a nice team in westerns you always have a female character & usually she is a dance hall performer today they call them hookers angie dickinson assays this role nicely also featured are western stalwarts john anderson & jack kelly it was film in old tucson outside of downtown tucaon az & the scenery is gorgeous typical of the older westerns there is not too much actionthere is some good humour & the usual ending shoot out it is a fast enjoyable 89 minutes ratings *** out of 10 84 pointsout of 100 imdb 7 out of 10	1
1353	the title role of this western is played by robert walker jr she s a young gun who with partner david carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a mexican general in eluding their pursuers carradine and walker become separated walker comes upon the camp of lawman robert mitchum who takes a liking to walker and makes her a prot√©g√© and reclamation project of sorts this is the first of two films robert mitchum did with writer director burt kennedy the second was the more humorous the good guys and the bad guys  not that young billy young does not have its moments of hilarity but it is a tripartite story involving the walker reclamation mitchum s hunt for the bad who killed her son and a romantic triangle involving mitchum angie dickinson and town boss jack kelly the film abounds with nepotism david carradine is john s son dean martin s daughter deana is in this walker is the son of robert walker and jennifer jones and mitchum s son chris plays mitchum s son in some silent flashbacks robert mitchum got her start in westerns and always looks right at home in them angie dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in rio bravo walker had a brief career playing rebellious youths and doing a good job at it i ve often wondered what happened to her she looks hauntingly like her father maybe she didn t want to come to such a tragic early end like her father and it that wasn t enough mitchum fans get to hear old rumple eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film	1
1354	if sicily is a territory of the baroque with its doubling of perspective that s part of this movie s challenge to realism and it s an exuberant pleasure here outdoing fellini with not one but three film directors plus of course the actual bellocchio who has made some really great movies and shouldn t be touchy about her honor there is a variety of takes and casting improvisations on manzoni s i promessi sposi with somewhere there actual marriage sicily is also taken to be a territory of skulduggery you already know this version of the island so there s no spoiler involved a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio castellito s work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a palazzo	1
1355	there is something that one of the characters the aging film director who pretends to be dead says which may summarize all the film in italy it s the dead who rule true this is a country without a future in the hands of old and jaded men and bellocchio s cryptic portrait of the country pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living manages to say a lot about what is not working here but foreigners may miss the point as it s not clearly expressed i understand that australian or canadian people who watch this may get bored and wonder if there s a meaning  well there s a meaning but it s clear only to people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open like bellocchio surely it s not one of her best films and it s not as powerful as buongiorno notte but it s worth seeing for italians who live in italy	1
1356	this film was a wonderful romp intelligent playful mysterious full of surprises with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy the famous film director the protagonist and the events she tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as she is nearly out maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of her there are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director the ending is so much the better for being untidy realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here if we are going to turn our weddings and our imaginative lives over to film directors we should be prepared for a wild ride this film seems to suggest	1
1357	this is the last episode of the goldenboy ova series kentaro finds herself working in an animation studio which is rather interesting if you don t know anything about the way anime studios were run besides episode 3 this was probably the least risqu√© but it had a nice girl interest as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes my only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn t based on one of the manga chapters but it ended well leaving us with the nice feeling that kentaro is permanently 25 studying on definitely watch the rest of the series all the way through you can buy the whole series for like $17 you can watch it all the way through in about 2 1 2 hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes free time which i do if i have a lunch break at school good series check it out	1
1358	finally other people who have actually seen this show it is the funniest anime i have ever seen but most people have even heard about it it is just hilarious  and so kintaro will continue to ride her trusty bike and maybe one day she will save the worldor maybe not  tare just some classic bits in it  and so she will ride onto the next citybecause she has no choice since her brakes are broken study study study  and some of the lessons that she writes down in her little notebook  today i had a very educational experience i tried to look backwards but unfortunately i was already looking that way it hurt todays lesson the human head cannot turn 360 degrees 	1
1359	someone says this anime could be offensive for girls not really embarrassing situations are funny first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing doesn t matter the age or gender a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn t be obvious by just reading the last page during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears episodes had a touching and funny ending specially last one i don t regret to buy these series	1
1360	endearingly silly anime only six episodes in duration about a hapless delivery boy called kintaro well she s called a delivery boy though she is meant to be in her 20 s and the adventures she has on her travels each episode sees her arriving in a new town acquiring a new job developing something of a love interest before each episode ends with her leaving gently sexist juvenile very immature at times this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face not one to start with if you are not a fan of anime as this certainly won t convince you about the genre but for those who are already converted this is entertaining fluff	1
1361	golden boy is in my opinion one the sleeper   lost treasures animes out there a sexy comedy about a young man quest to find her nitch in life and she blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for her but she not really realizing it its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing itwill fall for the comedy silliness that lies inside truly a crime that only produced 6 ova episodes and pilot movie were made however being unique as it is i m surprised it survived to produce that many if you want a good laugh with high quality anime that is 100% cgi free check this anime out boy who one day may save the worldor maybe not	1
1362	i liked this quite a bit but i have friends that hated this there s no sex but there s very little nudity in any of the episodes   which is a good thing also keitaro has a toilet fixation that s explored in at least half the episodes toilets are way more advanced in japan hmm i m wondering why i rated this so high myself it certainly isn t that i like naked cartoon girls in some ways keitaro oe the main character is analogous to johnny bravo except instead of being an obnoxious musclebound jock keitaro is a hyperactive nerd or you can think of her as japan s answer to leisure suit larry she s easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed but she grows on you either way if you give her a chance she is the goldenboy  the formula is the same for each episode boy meets girl boy tries to win girl s heart despite being a dorky pervert boy somehow succeeds against all odds typically the girl doesn t realize she likes keitaro until after she s beaten to a pulp and or pulled off some spectacular stunt like engineering a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a gasoline powered motorcycle using her bicycle episode #1 features a rich software tycoon i think animating her boobs put a major dent in the budget because she s the only female that has this kind of animation she also dresses completely unprofessionally most people who rate this negatively probably never got past the first episode episode #2 has the rich young daughter who likes to tease she s only 16 but that s legal age in japan and in some states in the us i might add her father is also a brutal yakuzza type that has a reputation for killing guys interested in her daughter  girl #3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner that s mixed up with a bad boyfriend aside from keitaro running interference for the maiden and being kissed by a guy there s almost no ecchi of any kind in this episode   a sharp drop from the previous two nevertheless keitaro and the evil boyfriend really pound each other episode #4 has keitaro trying to impress a top notch swimming coach keitaro seems more  direct  about her intentions with this particular girl than any other and she s pretty direct in return girl #5 is the biker babe she s probably the most top heavy of the 6 although not super buoyant like girl #1 and  raciest  in terms of sexuality and vulgarity this particular episode is easily the most over the top in terms of lack of realism keitaro should have broken every bone in her body at least twice during the race against the biker babe but i think the producers and writers said it s just a cartoon we can do anything this lapse in realism makes it a fan favorite finally episode #6 introduces a new girl that s works in animation and the previous 5 girls help keitaro as she tries to cope with impossible time and resource constraints to get an oav out the door by the deadline in terms of ecchi this one s very tame as well but there s plenty of humor the ending has all 5 extremely pretty girls from the past team up to hunt keitaro who slips away unnoticed ostensibly with the intention of gang raping her yeah that  almost  happens in real life someone crossed ukyo tachibana ala samurai shodown with steve urkelala family matters all in all there s no middle ground for this you ll either hate it or love it if you re new to anime you probably don t want to start with this at the same time if you can stand characters like happosai from ranma 1 2 or johnny bravo or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards silliness but have very sexual overtones you should give it a shot	1
1363	simply put there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out first the part where she was set to wash the toilet but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving her a golden shower i laughed so hard second the part where she tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor she seemed like a pro diving in but as expected she couldn t swim proper at least^^ however the funny part of this was when she finally reached the end and said how was that or something that was so friggin hilarious i couldn t stop laughing  if you get the chance to see this anime series i strongly recommend it one of the best i ve seen  definitely the funniest	1
1364	believe me when i say this show is just plain hilarious the basic story is about kintaro oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all she can about life kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made she takes everything to the extreme and it s just laugh out loud funny every time from her constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things she instantly blows up into life or death matters one of the funniest things about this show is simply kintaro s constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions she spends a great amount of time in various super deformed modes like dragon half or trigun other times in less then 01 seconds her face will turn not just serious but manga fighter style life or death expressions like a weight lifter trying to benchpress a new record it s hilarious if that wasn t enough the writing is superb and the english voice acting couldn t possibly be better kintaro s english va is just perfect and will have you rolling around when she s not even really saying anything the one thing to mention though is this is without a doubt an ecchi series it practically defines the word if you re an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like american pie you ll love this   rirath_com	1
1365	golden boy is ecchi humor bordering on hentai in the guise of educational moments the main character kintaro wanders around getting herself into the silliest situations involving women it s just that she s shy on the surface but analyses everything until she can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding her education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time	1
1366	although i m a girl thankfully i have a sense of humor and realize that this really is a funny anime watching it does give you an overwhelming feeling that it s definitely a guy show but that doesn t take away from the fact that its hilarious 10 10	1
1367	story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on halloween night in all my life i have never seen such a cheesy film but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting effects direction and script this is the best movie created for the halloween season since the original halloween and when they introduce linnea quigley s character for the first time she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins goodness they just don t get any better than this rush and buy this tape right away 5 10	1
1368	man i can t believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie okay it sure ain t no sophisticated work of cinematic art but it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun for starters the titular pumpkin headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera she looks like something you would see in a fourth rate carnival spookhouse secondly the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster then there s the always welcome presence of the ever lovely linnea quigley who s memorably introduced taking a nice long utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes amazingly we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil warlock and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host moreover scream queens brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith have fleeting cameos lead child actor ryan latshaw projects all the charm and acting ability of a moldy old tree stump pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and bares her cute little breasts the cruddy special effects are decidedly less than special the score is suitably overwrought yet this film overall has a certain endearingly hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real delectably cheesy hoot to watch	1
1369	my buddies and i spent the majority of a saturday afternoon watching a selection of bad movies among the flicks we watched the strongest contender for quality bad movie fare was easily jack o it s ludicrous that movies such as gigli glitter and you got served are listed in imdbs bottom 100 while they re certainly bad movies they don t belong in the bottom 100 they re robbing jack o and keeper of time etc of the bad movie greatness they so richly deserve so what makes jack o so great in bad movie terms for starters steve latshaw the director decided to cast her son ryan latshaw in the role of sean kelly unfortunately for steve ryan latshaw was dangerously close to being out acted by a block of wood the kid seriously has no ability to emote whatsoever the end result unintentional comic gold the kid could be listening to a joke or just moments away from getting her head smashed asunder and her expression is one of stony emotionlessness the other aspect of the movie that we found awesome was the sheer number of double dreaming sequences what is a double dream well it s when a character wakes up from a nightmare and then something equally nightmarish happens and then the character wakes up again basically they wake up after dreaming about waking up from a nightmare clever device no i believe the character of sean kelly experienced no less than 3 double dreaming sequences let s see what else oh yeah this movie has a veritable cast of thousands it s truly stunning to see how many speaking roles are introduced throughout the course of the movie best of all almost none of the characters have anything to do with the story they re either killed by jack o or they serve no purpose whatsoever jack o herself was pretty sweet like most other b movie monsters jack o has the amazing ability to seemingly teleport over great distances she s invariably hanging out somewhere in the background whenever you re dealing with a major character what s puzzling however is that when she s actually chasing someone she moves at a shambling stumbling speed and yet she s able to keep up with people who are sprinting that s all for now closing remarks if you re looking for a unintentionally hilarious bad movie you can t go wrong by renting this beast bad movie score 7 10 good movie score 35 10	1
1370	crazy scottish warrior race stranded deep in outer space low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of pluck with visual effects that semi suck but i kinda liked the freaky being if i met one then i d be fleeing but not if i had scottish mates we d f n swear and avoid that fate so in the end it wasn t botched it was a dvd i m glad i watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting didn t stall i ll tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year	1
1371	i believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of ¬£8000 but that didn t really show there wasn t anything amateurish about the production or the acting the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of aberdeen the actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious deserted and uncharted planet none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive there weren t any great explanations of what was going on which can be really contrived so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination rather like the big empty which was a film i also enjoyed i found that i quite warmed to most of the characters there were some perhaps unintentionally amusing moments the men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathise with them and the film s climax and ending were quite poignant i think mr stirton and her crew should be quite proud of themselves i ve seen worse films with a budget of millions	1
1372	i have to confess that i know some of those involved i was in the forerunner to the planet evil unleased however this was more than 10 years ago and i had since lost contact with them i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from it s director mark stirton this prompted me to order a copy of the film on dvd now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around ok it s not star wars but i ve seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passed ^mild spoilers^ the planet draws on several sci fi classics star wars alien pitch black forbidden planet and predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive the planet is a brilliant piece of sci fi film making that certainly hides it s limited budget well done to mark mike and all those involved i look forward to your next work	1
1373	people seem to be expecting citizen kane here the planet is a b monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed the director clearly has something to offer   not so sure about some of the cast as for the effects ¬£8000 ain t a lot of effects budgeti for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci fi head or anyone who doesn t take monster movies too seriously if so watch 3colours blue insteadi noticed one review saying it had ripped off alien like alien didn t rip things off the best thing about the film the director the worst thing about the film the cast maybe it s time for the director to move from glasgow to london and find some talent in the meantime   well done at least you re trying to do something	1
1374	got this the other day from the creators on dvd i saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel had never heard anything about it after reading it was filmed on balmedie beach i just had to buy it i used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in aberdeen 1st off im not a big sci fi fan baring star wars i was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location i was presently surprised this didn t turn out to be a standard sci fi more like a mix of sci fi and survival horror had a good storyline which was different had great special effects for the budget that it was produced with ¬£8000 acting was better than average for a low budget film the way they have edited out the whole coastline to make it feel like the dry desert planet that they are on was nice weapons in the film were realistic and the creatures were cool kinda like predator in invisibe mode all in all i will buy any future releases from these guys maybe a all out horror next hint hint the extras on the dvd were very informative on giving background for the producers i would like to see some of them shorts included as extras on a next dvd release excellent work keep it up	1
1375	i loved this movie yes it is rather cheap and i m sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that but my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved i was reminded of the early work of sam raimi yes it is rough but has good energy and plenty of fun the acting ranges from the very good in scott ironside and shawn paul hasser to the not so good in some of the lesser parts is it a cult movie well it grew on me first time i liked it but by the 3rd viewing i was loving it the movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but i m giving it 8 for sheer cheek anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching almost makes me want to visit scotland	1
1376	i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me and i couldn t put it down until the end and i had forgotten about my horrid day and the ending by the way where is the sequel the budget is obviously extremely low but  look what they did with it it reminds me of a play they are basically working with a tent a  escape pod  a few guns uniforms camping gear and a  scanner  thing that is it for props maybe this is even a good thing forcing the acting and writing to have to step up and take their rightful place in film as the centers of the work instead of as afterthoughts used to have an excuse to make cgi fights starwars the cgi is fine it is not exactly  seamless  but imho it still works why because there isn t too much of it and what there is is not  taking over  with an army of effects house people trying to cram everything they can into the shot it prompts the imagination it s some relatively simple stuff with decent composition especially the heavy freighter shot there is one long shot that must be at least ten secondsthat tracks the entire length of the ship it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence film making in the past 10 years to have an action sequence that lasts longer than 075 seconds and some relation to the story it might look old or not  state of the art  but it doesn t look stupid and it doesn t take away from the story the acting is good except the characters die too fast to get to know them the captain was great but a few of her scenes could have used another take i also got confused with her character losing her cool and stomping on a corpse i like to think captains are calm cool and in control what was going on in that scene did the other crew worry about her losing it at that moment did she feel herself losing control  now as for the plot mostly it is good why because it doesn t try to explain itself it just happens it s called  the planet  its a mystery get it nobody knows why there is a statue and they don t find out either the mysterious cult the weird scientist with the tattoo what do you expect to find out in less than 90 minutes this isn t war and peace and thank god it s not star wars trek either no midichlorians no 5 minutes of expository boring dialog that has no purpose in the story the characters are stranded and are only able to figure out a few basic things it is not a star trek episode where they find out it s leonardo davinci or a child like space wanderer it is mysterious and i liked that i don t know why maybe i can identify with these guys more  since they don t know whats happening and i don t either they don t talk a lot of space gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is happening  in fact i would argue that one of the weakest moments is when the  traitor  turns on the crew and tries to  explain  the reason for the planet the cult etc this coincidentally has some of the weakest dialog imho in the whole movie and it interrupts the flow and some of the characters look unnatural in that scene  ok sometimes i felt it was a little too mysterious though like why did the guy get fried through her eyes with lightning that was odd just weird the  hamlet  ending again i would have liked to have known some of these characters better and would it have been so hard to have a 30 second rescue scene at the end this is not a serial show it was a film and we like closure in films even if they can have a sequel imagine hamlet with no  flights of angels sing thee to thy rest  anyways what can i say this was well worth the dollar i payed at the  red box  machine at the supermarket it was also imho a better piece of storytelling than starwars parts 1 2 or 3 like i said it sucked me in wanting to know what was happening and i couldn t stop watching until the end	1
1377	ok so maybe it s because i m from the north east of scotland and i talk just like the guys in this film but i found this great fun cheap fun to be sure but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all i was actually quite effected when they died in particulare when the captain finally fell the script well its a game of 2 halfs the opening half of the film is well written and sharp the last half hour is not so great with many questions left unanswered this will doubtless annoy others as it annoyed me but nevertheless good fun and a very smart first feature from sturton	1
1378	on many levels it s very good in fact considering that this was a low budget british indie by a first time feature director with a largely neophyte cast it s a magnificent achievement i don t know how much it cost the figure of ¬£8000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is the point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix even having said that much of the script was great the characters were clearly identified and all had something to do this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless faceless blanks but these were ten characters   mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things throughout the middle act when the plot was developing the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters if the whole film was like the second act it would be stunning before the ship blows up twelve people make it to individual escape pods or  e pods  which blast away from the ship they re not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped cramped and have no real idea where they re going   but that makes sense i like the e pods   they re an excellent idea done very well and make more sense than a nice roomy escape capsule i also like the way that we are specifically told later that they are designed for ship to ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency   because let s face it these guys were bloody lucky that their ship was blown up so close to a planet that said it doesn t look to me like there are 116 unused e pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e pod   but in she gets and it has just occurred to me shouldn t the captain have gone down with her ship rather than being the first guy out of there anyway the e pods all land on a barren planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation   or at least on a sandy sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere nah it s a planet in a sci fi movie   it will be exactly the same all over we have to accept that all the e pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up firing flares into the sky to locate each other the captain a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if she gets the right agent decides that they should try and contact  captain behan  with whom they were intending to rendezvous but they cannot do this from the planet they need to get into orbit the engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere it can all be done on automatic but it will need a  pilot  to send the signal the captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team that s kid i really liked the way that she now points out that her name is david and the captain starts using it treating her with dignity and respect that was good storytelling and good characterisation	1
1379	i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it that s for sure did i see a painted water pistol in there maybe they don t have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland or maybe they just didn t have any money the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds awesome but what i really liked was the grit of the performances mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys no hollywood histrionics here ok so the effects work isn t very good the spaceships just don t look as good as they should in todays fx world and i ve seen much better free stuff on youtube but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew or is it just better effects work did they edit out the water by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died	1
1380	i d buy that for a dollar i did buy this film for a dollar and i ve seen much worse for much more this is a scottish sci fi film from mark stirton and according to the making of hysterical by the way the production only cost $8000 eight grand that wouldn t pay for half a minute in hollywood nevertheless      this is top fun film making if you like things gritty then you re in for a treat these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing i didn t mind but my girl friend did the actors do a fine job and it s interesting to see people that i ve never heard of or seen before it meant i had no idea who was going to die first if you watch a movie for it s  latest of the latest  visual effects then watch a star wars the effects here are ok but kinda weak in space but the monsters are very well done if a bit pred like stirton does an amazing job with not very much and i d love to see her take on a real hollywood movie it least it wasn t predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got her head blown off ok so it is a little derivative of other sci fi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci fi film for 8 g s is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting making of no standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end but why no commentary keep going scots	1
1381	the  7  rating is not necessarily a smear   this movie was done on a low budget   but done well within its limits a usual pot boiler plot   ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space people and prisoner escape in pods land on unknown planet where their presence wakes something up mayhem ensues a lot of ammo is expended the special effects were spare and properly done emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky cheap looking plastic props plus the pacing of the story moved without allowing the viewer to lapse into boredom where they start picking things apart i peg this one as a lite saturday afternoon flick you can get up and hit the fridge without pausing it and it ll still be enjoyable even better your girlfriend can talk all the way through it without damaging your enjoyment   and she ll be happy after all she got to talk to you it s that type of movie anyways the actual story line has s few holes in after they hit the planet but hey this is a guns  n  ammo action movie cohesive story lines are not necessarily required so long as you have beer and chips at hand so don t get get yourself into a brain cramp over the ending	1
1382	got the chance to see this at a friend s house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget not that this ever bothered me anyway since i love low budget sci fi like dr who blake s 7 and dark star hell even outland wasn t a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good the story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet they then discover the prisoner has made it too she s a stone cold nut case and that s only the start of their problems the effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings films like i robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of hollywood s offerings whilst none of the actors get oscar material it s tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn t outstay its welcome the characters don t get fleshed out much but then they didn t in predator either which it resembles in feel big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but i like it unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you can t get a handle on it at all and i d like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further a cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour if this is what they can do on a shoestring i d like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don t knock all the creativity out of them first recommended	1
1383	wow talk about a film that divides the audience this is a real love it or loath it kinda movie personally i really enjoyed it i noticed that other reviews are comparing it to pitch black   this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is sand people can be real stupid no this film is far more in common with the thing how people fail to notice is amazing   they even have the same basic music lots of carpenter touches are there blue collar heroes sharp humor endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood perhaps what stops this film being a real classic is it s deference to other carpenter works not least dark star which it has something in common with i d be interested to know how much it really cost $8000 is that even possible maybe it was based on a short film that cost $8000 but i did find myself strangely moved when the various space dudes died they are so underplayed that it s like watching a documentary at times having said that the script is kinda clunky and only about half of them can act however and i m not sure the big guy playing the captain is one of them but her gun is awesome give it a chance if you like early carpenter you might fall for it just don t expect 2001	1
1384	every once in a while you stumble across a movie that takes you by surprise and this is one of them on the surprise scale this would rate as sharing a hot tub with jessica alba whilst a band consisting of elvis jimi hendrix john lennon phil lynott and keith moon play you music for the night the reason why this film will surprise you is that for the meagre budget they had ¬£8000 and that this was done by a bunch of mates who just wanted to try it out they have produced something very slick and looks easily 100 times more than its budget the plot is simple a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space come under attack and are forced to crash land on a nearby desolate planet after some checks not only does the planet not exist according to star charts but they are not alone as it seems and something very unfriendly begins to pick them of one by one it sounds like very standard sci fi fare mixing elements of aliens predator and pitch black but it takes all these and makes them into something that feels fresh and original the location shooting in this is fantastic utilising balmeddie beach in aberdeen to the maximum and you genuinely feel that you are one an alien world the seemingly never ending sand dunes and clever lighting effects give it a very bleak feel  you truly think the crew are stranded on an alien world also the action sequences are superb the opening assault on the freighter a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and the firefights as well as the stunning finale all showcase the inventiveness of the film as for the team of mercenaries the cast excels themselves for a low budget independent movie the casting here was done via local media outlets and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future local body builder mike mitchell whilst not a natural actor slots into her role as the arnie esq leader of the mercenaries from the rest of the cast there are two stand out performances patrick wright as second in command mcneal and scott ironside as the rough and ready engineer vince both have some the best lines in the movie and scott injects a good bit of humour into the movie with her performance patrick gives a well rounded performance as the cool as ice second in command director mark stirton can be very proud of what she has achieved and shows that scottish cinema need not all be  kilts and ceilidhs  or  slums and drugs  scottish films can be fresh inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun this film is scottish with a north east flavour to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece although the budget limitations show from time to time the only fault i could find that is to be expected this film its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then some more i for one wish mark and her crew every success and theirs is a career to keep a very close eye on rating   9 10 the first scottish sci fi is bold fresh and inventive a real triumph movie reviews news and opinion like no other plus the kick ass bi weekly pod casts wwwfightrunnercouk  contact@fightrunnercouk	1
1385	the planet is an astounding piece of film making for a mere ¬£8000 stirton production have turned out one of the most original sci fi films for a long time starring the physically intimidating mike mitchell the film is a mix of great special effects strong storytelling and well planned action from the opening space battle to the pounding finale everything about this film appears well above it s budget to start with the special effects while certainly not revenge of the sith standard they are on level if not above the likes of babylon 5 and farscape and for a snip of a price as well the detail and the movement is superb and captures the imagination from the off the design of everything ships weapons entities is second to none the imagination and creativity involved is a real surprise for a film of this budget another surprise was the strength of the story and the arc it takes there are a few twists and turn most of which are well written into the script surprising and well played out i was surprised that two years in the making and first imagined 15 years ago how relevant some aspects of the story are to today s society with the happenings around the world there may be a certain resonance with the lengths the mercenaries are forced to go to in order to survive even the sounds effects are spot on as is the atmospheric music the use of light and costume add further to the professional look balmedie beach in aberdeen looks a desolate and lonely place in all honesty this film looks 10 if not 100 times the budget spent and that s testament to a creative hard working team of people from the director to the cast to the effects via the producer and sound team wonderful effort i recommend you get your hand on a copy asap	1
1386	gzsz is the longest running daily soap in germany and it s cult i started watching it from the first day on and i got hooked on it right from the start over the years so much has changed the old characters like heiko elke tina saskia etc left and new ones appeared like marie kai cora or john i have to say that i liked gzsz better in the years 1995 2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters my favorite character is sonja wiebe because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show tina bordihn was great as the first sonja but as tokessa became the recast of sonja the character got even better	1
1387	okay i m just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show i happen to think this show is awesome i mean when jasmin weber was still on and franzi was still alive so addicting and i was surprised to learn that this was categorized as a soap because it just doesn t carry the same look and feel as soaps in america soaps here are absolutely horrific at least gzsz films on location features real music and more plausible story lines moreover the acting on gzsz for the most part is quite believable especially with josephine schmidt and felix jascheroff plus soap actors are some of the hardest workers around in the business as they have the most demanding work schedules if it s ratings are that high it must be doing something right soaps in america are shown in the day time and historically have always had rock bottom ratings give gzsz a chance trust me it s good	1
1388	an on screen caption informs us that it is  the caribbean sea may 1891  a small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship and the ship s doctor a lt claude de ross claudio cassinelli it s night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange unnamed and uncharted island the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish man creature the next morning morning claude wakes up to find herself washed upon a beach she finds a pool of white bubbling water and one of the prisoners dead beside it claude warns another surviving prisoner jose franco iavarone not to drink the water as it will kill her they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners peter roberto posse francois francesco mazzeri and skip giuseppe castellano francois wanders off on her own to try and catch an animal for food she finds and kills a large water bird but in turn she is killed herself by one of the fish men claude jose peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put francois s death down to an animal attack of some sort soon after skip is killed when she is impaled on a spike at the bottom of a pit now only claude jose and peter are left they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic rituals claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes a woman on horseback named amanda marvin barbara bach is revealed to be claudes saviour she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund rackham richard johnson and she doesn t like visitors claude jose and peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding rackham s large house in which they are invited to stay that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp peter quickly becomes food for the fish men and a voodoo priestess called shakira beryl cunningham who lives with rackham performs a black magic ritual involving slitting the throat of a chicken at the cemetery the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about rackham and think she is lying to them jose rides off on horseback and is lost claude is saved from one of the fish men by amanda and is again told to leave claude wants to confront rackham again rackham reveals that she has a scientist and amanda s father named professor ernest marvin joseph cotten who she needs to be kept alive rackham says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of her own survival will dramatically increase rackham tells claude her plan rackham has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2000 feet she is using the fish men as a means of getting at the lost treasures of atlantis and needs amanda and her father to control them she claims the fish men are descendants of the original inhabitants of atlantis rackham offers claude a share of the treasure if she will help her keep ernest alive later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments transplanting animal organs into human beings finding ernest s secret laboratory she discovers rackham had lied to her and the fish men aren t descendants their actually genetically altered people turned into amphibious creatures by ernest s grotesque experiments rackham has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to her meddling by sticking her in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands volcano starts to erupt and send lava flying everywhere rackham wants to leave the island with her treasures and amanda will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the erupting volcano tears it apart directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres the script by sergio donati is fast paced interesting and entertaining the plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through i must say at this point that i ve seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it s us release by roger corman barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off i thought it was more than a little distasteful richard johnson makes a great villain and claudio cassinelli a likable hero the fish men themselves look a little fake when the camera lingers on them too long but their cool looking and i ve seen worse some of the miniature effects look a little poor too but overall again i ve again seen a lot worse there s no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didn t really bother me actually the photography by giancarlo ferrando and the production design by massimo antonello geleng combine to create a very nice looking film period costumes props and sets like rackham s house and ernest s lab with it s old scientific equipment the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual splendour on show i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it s running time i m not sure who i d recommend it too as it mixes various genres i guess someone who maybe fancies something a little bit different and generally well made if you can find a copy give it a go i m glad i did	1
1389	this movie is based on the novel island of dr moreau by hg wells it s a fairly good one too it s at least better than the version by john frankenheimer	1
1390	1891 stalwart morally upright military doctor lieutenant claude de ross solid claudio cassinelli and several other shipwreck survivors wash ashore on a remote tropical island that s governed with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic edmund rackham superbly played to the deliciously slimy hilt by richard johnson who lives on the island with the feisty amanda martin a winningly spunky performance by the ravishing barbara bach and her unhinged rogue biologist father professor ernest martin a marvelously dotty portrayal by joseph cotten moreover de ross discovers that professor martin has control over a dangerous race of fishman beasts who are being exploited as slave labor by rackham director co writer sergio martino relates the lively and absorbing story at a constant snappy pace offers a flavorsome evocation of the lush and remote tropical setting does an expert job of creating and maintaining a creepy and mysterious atmosphere in the spooky opening third further spices things up with a nice line in dry humor and stages the exhilarating action loaded climax with considerable rip roaring aplomb while the central premise is obviously inspired by the island of dr moreau the story nonetheless is given a great deal of freshness and intrigue because of martino s artful melding of such diverse elements as voodoo the lost underwater city of atlantis a rousing mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption buried treasure unscrupulous genetic experiments and even some exciting rough tumble fisticuffs between de ross and rackham during the thrilling conclusion into an altogether dynamic imaginative and often immensely entertaining whole the sound acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another substantial plus cassinelli makes for a likable hero johnson essays her juicy villain part with supremely lip smacking aplomb bach rates as a quite fetching damsel in distress plus there are neat supporting contributions by beryl cunningham as sinister voodoo priestess shakira franco iavarone as the superstitious jose and roberto posse as surly troublemaker peter giancarlo fernando s sumptuous widescreen cinematography delivers a wealth of striking visuals while luciano michelini s throbbing tribal score hits the funky spot the amphibious humanoid fishman creatures are pretty gnarly looking too an extremely fun flick	1
1391	watching this odd little adventure movie it s hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpion s tail but it has to be said that despite it s low quality production values island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it s getting like many italian films from the seventies this is one is a rip off of a successful american film the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau sergio martino s film takes ideas such as mutation greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film which makes up for what it s lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into fish men   a cross between a man and a fish which exist for purely selfish reasons the truth about this movie is that it s a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values the central monsters look completely ridiculous and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies   but the movie is well shot in spite of this with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring the way that the plot comes together isn t exactly genius but it takes in a lot of ideas and i ve seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis to be honest i m not a massive fan of adventure movies and therefore don t see this lost city get mentioned much   but it is always nice to see it in a movie the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme overall this isn t exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one	1
1392	lt claude claudio cassinelli and several prisoners from her sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham richard johnson following a few random prisoner deaths rackham takes in claude and her two remaining prisoners luckily for everyone barbara bach just happens to be on the island too unluckily there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all   a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist director sergio martino handles herself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so that can t be said for her belated follow up the fishmen and their queen 1995 easily one of the wackiest and most off base sequels since highlander ii	1
1393	i saw this movie on television as screamers and loved it i heard an interesting story about this film when roger corman released it to drive ins in the summer of 1981 her trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film it was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster during the film s opening at drive in s irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see theater owners called corman and said their customers felt ripped off so corman had to run off copies of the footage and send the positive film to theater owners to splice into the film themselves since the footage was never part of the film negative it has not appeared in any video dvd or television broadcast has anyone ever seen this footage anyone who saw this film at a drive in in the summer of 1981 remember this	1
1394	action packedwith my favorite type of creaturei won t give any of it away if you have nt seen itcause it s worth taking the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things as presented in this filmit did gets slow at times and those were the moments my mind wondered which does easily anyways but moist of it kept me quietly thrilledwhere you keep it in your head instead of letting it outprobably the mood i was in at the timespecial effects and action sequences you could feel made up for the occasional lullsof course there es a duschload of movies out there exactly like thisthe film still has it s own style and flavorwhich i respect from underground independent horror movies anyways	1
1395	although the video box for many copies of this film claims it is about people turned inside out this is a total lie in fact apart from the opening segment the film isn t even a horror movie with its sunken treasure legions of fish people and mad scientists it s a lot more like a doug mcclure adventure movie obviously this film is no work of art but it s kind of fun to watch just be warned that the beginning is quite gory	1

1397	fans of euro horror flicks   portland s video dvd store movie madness has a whole section devoted to this genre   can t afford to miss sergio martino s gut busting l isola degli uomini pesce called screamers in the united states here s the lowdown some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted caribbean island in 1891 the island is inhabited by a landowner a scientist joseph cotten and her daughter barbara bach sure enough it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish men and while the fish men remain calm as long as they can drink their potion they get nasty otherwise this movie is sort of a mixture of genres euro horror swashbuckling voodoo and maybe a little bit of the island of dr moreau but it s mostly an excuse to have the fish men disembowel trespassers ya gotta love that i wouldn t be surprised if the euro horror genre gave quentin tarantino some of her ideas for grindhouse after all the european horror directors have no scruples about what they show this is one that you re sure to like so joseph cotten is the only cast member from an alfred hitchcock movie i mean shadow of a doubt who later co starred with ringo starr s soon to be wife and audrey hepburn s ex by whom i mean mel ferrer in an italian horror flick the things that we see in life	1
1398	screamers is an italian fantasy film l isola degli uomini pesce bought by roger corman and released through her new world pictures of course corman has to carve her initials on it by having one of her lackeys dan t miller direct some additional gore footage before she has it released in the states l isola degli uomini pesce is a very entertaining retelling of the island of dr moreau it is 1891 and claudio cassinelli is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with a few newly escaped convicts claudio comes across the stellar barbara bach and richard johnson johnson plays the dastardly edmund rackham a man who is able to manipulate scientist joseph cotton into turning the local native population into amphibious deep sea diving creatures they look like a cross between the black lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the deep by convincing cotton that the mutations are being created for the highest of scientific and humanitarian motives having discovered the lost city of atlantis rackham is using the amphibious creatures to loot its treasures sexy barbara bach plays cotton s daughter who has a psychic link with these mutations in one memorable scene bach takes a midnight swim with these mutants wearing only a thin white cotton dress that leaves little to the imagination claudio discovers one of the convicts she has befriended has been turned into a gill creature and then all hell breaks loose filmed at the same time and in the same location as zombi 2 richard johnson didn t even have to change suits between films the house where the experiments take place is the same house johnson uses to conduct experiments in zombi 2 talk about economic filmmaking the additional footage features a few bloody beheadings way to go roger and a laughably bad cameron mitchell doing her best pirate imitation all that s missing is the parrot spanish title le continent des hommes poissons	1
1399	this movie surprised me the box is misleading the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading the movie is quite gory well acted and beautifully shot the special effects are top notch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like it s tone would suggest it is a unique take on the dr moreau story and one of the better versions filmed the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesn t ever really fall apart definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume horror classics and gore fests	1
1400	i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around    first the good old scummy sleazy embassy vhs print called screamers and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone s new favorite media company no shame of italy the american adverts about men turned inside out is as everyone says totally misleading and indicative of a roger cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy adventure thriller for grown ups the complete italian version is a somewhat sprawling well designed and deliberately paced take on island of dr moreau and there s nothing wrong with that it s a sumptuous handsome euro horror outing with a brain good plotting character development location shooting period costuming and sets etc but i must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid sleazy and unkempt roger corman version which has some nice over the top gore a flashy but preposterous opening segment and then the bulk of martino s original film albeit somewhat abridged to make room for roger s idea of entertainment the pacing was somewhat quicker the shock sequences closer together and you see just as much of ms bach s fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version i still don t have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of a local voodoo subplot didn t help much and it s funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist  perhaps a few more viewings are in order i will say this fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these pal imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video    the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling her screen with interesting stuff nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print but it s still interesting stuff and once again proof that while her standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter roger corman new good trashy fun when she had it made for her and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be 7 10	1
1401	sure most people will designate island of the fishmen as silly and trashy hokum but can you honestly name one other movie that brings forward this many exhilarating themes this italian gem stands for pure entertainment and features stuff like voodoo volcanic eruptions mutant fish creatures the mysterious continent of atlantis treasure hunting a remote island filled with death traps and utterly mad scientists all this and much more in one simple movie yes please close minded opponents of italian horror cinema can easily tag this film as a cheap exploitation version of the island of dr moreau but the truth is that this is so much more island of the fishmen delivers thrills and adventure from start to finish with surprisingly convincing special effects and astonishingly stylish camera work the story promisingly opens with a small group of prisoners survivors of a shipwreck washing ashore a tropical island they encounter the sadistic edmond rackham who rules over a native tribe¬Öand a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the island s swamps there are so many twists and additional sub plots in the story that it s almost impossible to write a summary but trust me this gem is worth checking out sergio martino once again proves that she s an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be commercial minded and creative at the same time she makes great use of the beautiful island location and also the interior sets look very impressive the staggering underwater footage and imaginative scenery really lift this film high above the normal standards of late 70 s exploitation i don t quite understand why roger corman reworked the original so much and released it on the american market under a different title screamers because there are very few elements open for improvement the cast members are all sergio martino regulars with the exception of the great joseph cotton is a neat supportive rule and give away great performances in case you can get your hands on the recently restored german version you re treated to fifteen uncut minutes of extra action see it	1
1402	this is a very odd movie for harold lloyd  at least in regard to the sweet character she played in movies throughout the 1920s and 30s instead of a nice guy she and snib pollard are con men  out to rob everyone blind in a particularly successful con chester pretends to have lost a very valuable ring and a bit later harold finds it as a stooge is also looking for the ring the ring of course is a cheap one dropped and then found by harold but the greed of the stooge is so great she convinces harold to say nothing and sell her the valuable ring and then they run away to enjoy their luck again and again they find patsies until they meet up with a woman who herself is a con woman working with a guy doing fake s√©ances she arranges a nifty con and takes all the money they stole  and has a cop standing by to make sure they give her the money as luck would have it the two con men stumble into the lady s shady business when no one is home soon the lady returns and messes with their minds  releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their wicked ways all around this is a completely odd and contrived film but it is also exceedingly funny as the jokes work very well and lloyd and pollard make an excellent team plus while creepy and strange i liked seeing pollard dressed like a lady	1
1403	i just watched this an early harold lloyd short film that featured her glasses character on kino video s dvd of the harold lloyd collection she s actually a con man with snub pollard as her partner who gets discovered by bebe daniels who herself performs fake s√©ances what she discovers is that lloyd and pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are lost i ll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when harold and snub enter the place bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like snub trying one of bebe s outfits not too much slapstick but what there is of was also quite funny so on that note i recommend are crooks dishonest	1
1404	was struck at how even the acting was throughout william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film not over the edge there are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when she is waiting to see the superintendent very well done  thoroughly enjoyed the flick 	1
1405	a brash self centered army cadet arrives at west point with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the corps in a role obviously tailor made for her william haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship a grade a scene stealer haines during the first half of the film is up to her usual silly billy behavior which under normal circumstances should have gotten her confined to the guardhouse the last half however becomes very serious leading up to haines  moral redemption and giving her a fine opportunity to exhibit her acting talents if west point does not quite reach the caliber of haines  previous tell it to the marines 1926 this is doubtless due to the absence here of a costar of the charisma & quality of lon chaney for haines to interact with however this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merit joan crawford appears as haines  love interest playing the virginal daughter of the local innkeeper joan is pert & pretty and especially shines in her first scenes when she meets haines on a hudson river ferry and is subjected to her usual immature antics haines & crawford made five silent feature films together and were tremendous friends for life she was the much bigger celebrity at this period and gave her many hints for getting ahead in hollywood a superstar herself by the early 1930 s she reciprocated after her ouster from mgm in 1932 by encouraging her career change to interior decoration little william bakewell is effectively cast as a plebe who idolizes haines their relationship is actually given more of a sentimental treatment than that of haines & crawford the film was made with the full cooperation of the war department extensive location filming at the academy helps tremendously with the production s ambiance which was given splendid production values by mgm west point has been recently restored and given a rousing new score by david davidson	1
1406	haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks west point will really amount to something now that she has arrived haines displays her easy goofy comic persona as she takes on west point and joan crawford the local beauty great fun for the first half and amazingly touching after haines s character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets the new humility filled haines get s alast minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against navy and despite a broken arm wins the game great rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film shows billy at her best william bakewell also scores as the skinny follower the handsome but goony character would be played by clark gable cary grant gary cooper and others in later decades another take on the beautiful but daffy dames played by carole lombard and marion davies west point is a winner	1
1407	i found west point to be an agreeable film although i doubt that i would watch it again the performances were convincing with william haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has her come uppance by film s end it s hard to believe that stardom beckoned joan crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times  i would apply the comment made by another concerning ramon novarro s huddle 1932 to this film as well there is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized but i was less involved than i thought that i would be perhaps haines  character went too far or got away with too much her repentance did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for her to run every play in the last minutes of the army navy game where s the corps in that might as well have taken out the other ten men and let her do it all herself also i doubt very much that william bakewell s weak puny character would ever have a real life counterpart at west point all this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring it is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution thank goodness that tradition still means something at west point too unlike the vapid traditions of ivy league schools only half heartedly engaged in these days as to the score it was appropriately martial but there was a distinct over use of snare drums using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et alu as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious it rather lessened the viewing experience i was ready to say i get the point already  with that enjoy the film but don t expect too much emotional involvement	1
1408	william haines sparks this tale of a brash cadet who thinks west point will really be something now that she has arrived terrific goony comic performance by haines was her trademark  one that made her a top box office star from 1928 1932 and one of mgm s biggest stars joan crawford and william bakewell are fine too and although this storyline may seem trite now this was a huge hit putting haines and crawford in a college football a national craze during the 20s story after haines blows off her big mouth one time too often and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets she turns in a wonderful performance as she swallows her pride and gets into the big game against navy even with a broken arm she wins the game for army and regains her place at west point it s easy to see from this film and show people with the always underrated marion davies why billy haines was a huge star of the time she needs and deserves to be remembered	1
1409	it is a shame that this series hasn t been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house copies of most episodes are available but are usually of poor quality being copies of copies of copies as i understand it 92 episodes were produced during its run but only 15 are noted here some of the series writers such as richard matheson went on to become noted authors excellent series well written well staged and well produced michael weldon udon thani thailand	1
1410	at the same time john russell was playing ranch owner nathan burdette trying to free her no good brother claude akins from sheriff john wayne in rio bravo she was working the other side of the law on television these years were probably the high point of russell s career her most noted screen role and her most famous television role marshal dan troop of laramie in lawman russell kept law and order in laramie the same way that james arness did it in dodge city on gunsmoke unlike gunsmoke laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of dodge city at the time instead it concentrated on russell taking care of business and learning the business of law to her eager young deputy peter brown brown played deputy johnny mckay who was a most respectful young man constantly referring to her boss as mr troop she was pretty handy with a shooting iron but was inclined to be impulsive good thing marshal troop was around the other series regular was the kitty russell of laramie lily played by peggie castle this is where lawman most resembled gunsmoke there was an unspoken understanding between russell and castle that even the smallest of children couldn t have missed and i wasn t the smallest of children when lawman was in first run sadly peggie castle developed substance abuse problems after lawman s run ended i remember a small obituary marked her passing in the first half of the seventies she was one beautiful woman lawman was good no nonsense western from that golden era of the adult television western it was one of the best	1
1411	the theme song often goes through my head after all these years i was never much of a tv watcher probably because i was just entering my busy teen years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life but from the first episode of lawman i was hooked and it is the only tv show i ve ever scheduled my week around intelligent believable well written and well acted and john russell is still to me the most beautiful man i ever saw peter brown was no dog either o  i agree that it is one of the most underrated tv series of all time i hope i can find some episodes for my grandchildren to watch	1
1412	johnny crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval billy graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet sometimes corny but all the way sincere flick she gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good solid advice that holds true today about morals decisions the generation gap teen dating some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding they sound like today s stats just to see billy in her younger days is worth seeing it s an awesome movie it made me realize that human nature does not change even though hair fashion and language may change humans are still struggling with the same issues they have been struggling with for thousands of years	1
1413	subject matter cosmology quantum physics and stephen hawking soundtrack phillip glass have i died and gone to heaven  you will be enraptured	1
1414	an introspective look at the relationship between hawking and the space time contingent this film expores the gallilean and newtonian laws and there relation to einstein s theory of general relativity the film is methodically directed exposing details of the man hawking as well as her work black holes interviews with her family are a little too long so sadly there is less development of her theories and ideas  a philip glass soundtrack superbly compliments the film only one other man could compose such haunting instellar melodies jean michel jarre overall i would highly recommend this movie on the basis of hawking s  nuggets of wisdom  and her adequate explanation of an event horizon	1
1415	stephen hawking has one of the greatest minds or if that s too simplistic to coin for her one of the most curious and daring that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves her in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate perhaps i didn t know enough about hawking going in i always knew her as  that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you know  that she is british that she was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left her dead at 21 put her in the position of putting her life in focus according to errol morris s equally curious and coolly visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time hawking was already brilliant in spurts when other oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations she answered more than three times the amount in an hour s time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists she bounced back with her own beneath some of the complex scientific talk  and if you got any less than a b  in astronomy like me you ll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of time s possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole  there s a human being who just wants to enjoy her goose on her birthday morris captures hawking just right for those who can t get enough of her theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time but she also captures the back story on the man and her condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other too much talk about the cosmos would make one s head hurt and too much about her personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who s book of the film s title was on bestseller lists for over five years almost in spite of her appearance hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which she observes she won t be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another 10 billion years from now through it all in a brief history of time we get a glimpse of a genius and her humility not to mention her colleagues and family s  ten cents here and there through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe	1
1416	a brief history of time the cosmological content of this documentary is fascinating the thoughts provoking and the man brilliant yet i had a hard time enjoying this documentary  the way the family members and professors are interviewed feels so unnatural these members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed uncomfortably mostly their accounts came across as very acted and forcefully directed the deliberate non inclusion of asked questions manipulates the given information into a very harsh and impersonal format  i do not know who are responsibly for the interviewing but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experience overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented	1
1417	stephen hawkings is a genius she is the king of geniuses watching this movie makes me feel dumb but it s a great movie not highly entertaining but very very intriguing the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings a man who makes einstein look average and her theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they ll write it all down well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen watch this and listen in on how she has formulated theories on black holes awesome you won t be the same after you see it	1
1418	i have been a huge errol morris fan ever since i saw thin blue line and heard it saved a life to date this movie is her best piece of work the plot is a mixing of stephen hawking s book of the same title intertwined with the man s life the story is told through interviews with family friends and hawkings herself don t be fooled it totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking the blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining i was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man tho physically powerless hawking s greatness and shear brilliance is encapsulated into a real live human being that we are allowed to laugh at and aw over at the same time find this movie watch it and enjoy and if the studio who owns this picture reads this a 15 year anniversary edition would be perfect now	1
1419	based on stephen hawking s a brief history of time this amazing film by eroll morris documents the the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy she has contributed more to science despite her debilitating disease als than an able bodied scientist could only dream of the film begins by telling of hawking s childhood and how she was a poor student that was recognizably bright she slacked her way through college and university where she was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal functions of her body but would allow her to continue living and thinking perfectly morris discusses how the brilliant mind of stephen developed from childhood to the present at one point her mother tells how  when she was pregnant  she prophetically bought a astronomical atlas to read while in the hospital hawking herself narrates the timeline of her discoveries while morris interviews close friends and colleagues whom have been lucky enough to befriend the magnificent man  she tells how she was first intrigued by the discovery that the universe was expanding similar to how a star would expand we also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as black holes if this is the casewill the universe not too begin to contract reversing itself until we reach the big crunch as hawking puts it and when the universe does begin to recede will time not reverse when posed this question i began to think that death may not be the end perhaps one day time will go backwards and our death will become our rebirth and our birth our death the universe is one big cycle just like everything else in life  this is what hawking is telling us everything in the universe recycles itself this is completely logical and can make your mind wonder in a million directions pondering it this is why i love this film and why isay it is a must see an 11 out of 10 morris never ceases toamaze	1
1420	a brief history of time is not only a documentary on the beginning and the ending of the universal and reality as we know it this is a story about the man and the genius known as stephen hawking it is her story that reflects the story of time and change throughout the history of the universal the style of the documentary   editing style of the interviews begin and end with a quick fade to black almost like blinking in between segments and interviews the documentary gives you an odd feeling like this is the view point of stephen hawking and not the eye of the camera the running time is only a little longer than an hour it is a short story then again its subject matter could be talked about for days and days an interesting and proud story	1
1421	warning may contain some minor spoilers hard to say anything bad about this movie except for one thing you don t get to see it much anymore  then again maybe that s because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the fox movie channel too bad for this is another gem lost to time clifton webb takes her patented sour know it all demeanor she had perfected as lynn belvedere sitting pretty and sequels and turns  nature boy  actually it s like this webb plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children s educational program that is losing audience share and the network breaks it to her that she needs to do something about it or else part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children bummer  but as such things happen the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of boy scouts and finds a willing victim  ahhhh  volunteer   in the host so jordan she takes the position problem solved right  wrong  this being a movie there are other problems for example it turns out one of the scouts is the son of her boss at the tv station which causes a little friction especially since the kid is overweight has asthma as well as an attitude and she is the more reasonable one also there is this cub scout mike george winslow who wants to hang around being the  stray puppy  type as it turns out the reason is that she has no folks of her own but is cared for by a relative who hasn t much time for her it is things like this that makes her job harder than expected  all in all webb becomes more understanding of kids and not only saves her show but learns a rewarding lesson and eventually even adopts mike still a great movie after all these years	1

1425	this movie was never intended as a big budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy it probably won t change your life but it is certainly charming and engaging clifton webb plays a curmudgeon that s certainly not new who has a tv however her ratings are failing and she is worried about cancellation so she decides maybe she is too out of touch with kids  as she and her wife have none of their own so she volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately remember she is a curmudgeon and doesn t particularly like kids to make things worse one of the kids really likes her and follows her like a lost puppy no matter how indifferently she acts towards the kid the child just wants to spend time with her the kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by herself  what happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you ll just have to find out for yourself understand that this is a light cute and yet not cloying movie you ll probably enjoy	1
1426	a middle aged man robert jordan set in her ways takes on a boy scout troop after her predecessor leaves under duress jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so she can revive her flagging radio program which is losing it s appeal to the younger set she has a rough go at first with the boys especially so with mike an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated do things work out for jordan and the scouts check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days	1
1427	clifton webb as mr scoutmaster is one of the all time greats for comedy and remembering an innocence now diminished in the world i cannot understand why the networks like american movie classics and such do not show this movie although i have requested it time and again this movie should be shown to children now for its portrayal of loyalty respect dedication and resolve to achieve the best possible on an individual basis there is so much low self esteem talked about in present daily lives but this movie among many many others would be a wonderful learning tool for the present day younger generation to see what can be accomplished by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to better yourself sad that this type of movie does not appeal to modern audiences it certainly appealed to us  baby boomer  generation of yesterday old lessons are universal and timeless	1
1428	i saw this mini movie when it first aired and loved itit kinda funny to see how far people will go for moneyit s also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be whipped whipped enough to kill i think the cast was great especially the character kristinwithout her smooth talkingand deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations 	1
1429	a proof that it s not necessary for a movie to have a deep many layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more sociological way people lust for money it seems that it s perfect just the way it is through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen  but the acting for me isn t so good with the exception of lindsey mckeon the others were average or even worst in some scenes they just empty stared in front of themselves for exception of lindsey which was more convincing it s a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying  7 10	1
1430	the man with the golden arm otto preminger s controversial panoramic crime drama plays itself out among the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants in rhythmic lashing arrangement opening the film a closeup from within a bar of frankie looking in through the window already tells us to the prominence that the protagonist s subjective experience will grasp pulled in the direction of increasingly slighter spaces the film shuts itself off as the local gangster s long drawn out poker game shuts itself from the daylight bolts itself in as sinatra s frankie machine has herself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of her harrowing struggle to overcome her habit in delving into the shapes and faces of its jazzy urban haven the visual traffic in the man with the golden arm characterizes skewed psychological circumstances forming an overpowering environment as maintained by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of frankie s eyes the grace of this fiery drama striking as early as the exciting opening crane shot displays the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows the wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place with no beginnings or ends an indeterminate state the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this skid row seems to before being gentrified or leveled the flair of certain performances particularly robert strauss s as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss schwiefka and arnold stang as frankie s trusty four eyed lapdog becomes this fiery surreal feature pleasingly the premise of drug addiction sinatra s powerhouse performance elmer bernstein s infectious forceful jazz score and saul bass s famous influential and controversial opening sequence centering on the animated paper cut out of a heroin addict s arm ensured that in its era the man with the golden arm presses forward upon the cause for realism in the still reticent hollywood it is impressionistic and subjective as i say but its intent its force and its spirit are much closer to home what absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film it has the illegal card games short cons the fights the guns the double crosses characters on the lam a femme fatale a stunningly sexy gun moll the shady nightclubs and urban landscape but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment really it is the perfect environment and genre in which to tell this story a crime ridden urban borough where it s all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two or three or four or drugs a transient dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could bid	1
1431	but quite dated today otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then it was enormously courageous and risky as she could have lost her investment and future the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized frank sinatra and i ve never been a fan playing frankie machine is astonishing in her performance one forgets it is frank up there the level of realism she brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed kim novak eternally gorgeous and talented does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider always there for frankie supporting roles particularly a young handsome and talented darrin mc gavin are faultless eleanor parker playing frankie s wife is hopelessly inept she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top a forgettable performance the stagey cheap settings are appalling as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness the music was irritating poundingly so at times as if each nuance of the script example when louie is getting frankie her fix out of a drawer had to be underscored at a high decibel level 7 out of 10 sinatra truly deserved her oscar nomination worth seeing	1
1432	the moon is blue director otto preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in her controversial 1955 release the man with the golden arm whereas she had incensed the motion picture association of america with her use of the words virgin and mistress in her mild 1953 comedy the moon is blue preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with the man with the golden arm since dick powell made her law and order epic to the ends of the earth1946 about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics based on nelson algren s novel that won the 1950 national book award this gritty uncompromising 119 minute black & white melodrama deals with heroin addiction initially when preminger s film came out the motion picture association of america would not issue its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted addiction to narcotics this groundbreaking film qualified as the first major motion picture to handle narcotics from the dope fiend s perspective and actually showed the paraphernalia that junkies wielded to shoot up heroin the production code stipulated that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illicit narcotics nevertheless united artists released this unique frank sinatra picture and it grossed over $4 million dollars  the critical and commercial success of the man with the golden arm eviscerated the production code as a result the mpaa amended the code so that filmmakers could delve into other taboo subjects such as drug abuse kidnapping abortion and prostitution the film received three academy award nominations oscar nominations went to sinatra for best acting joseph c wright and darrell silvera for best art direction set decoration black and white and elmer bernstein for best music scoring of a dramatic or comedy picture indeed elmer bernstein made a name for herself with her jazzy score the producers had thought about casting marlon brando in the title role but sinatra beat brando to the punch eleanor parker kim novak arnold stang darren mcgavin and robert strauss co starred with ole blue eyes mcgavin was particularly memorable as a sleazy heroin dealer while eleanor parker played the protagonist s wife with a dark deep secret of her own that comes as quite a shock  the man with the golden arm refers to protagonist frankie machine s ability to manipulate a deck of cards frankie deals cards for zero schwiefka robert strauss of stalag 17 but she has been out of chicago for the last six months in a federal narcotics hospital recovering from heroin addiction not only has frankie licked the habit but she also has learned how to play the drums and plans to embark of a music career optimistic as frank is about her future she finds herself facing her past all over again when she returns to her old stomping grounds schwiefka wants her to deal for her again and nifty louie fomorowski darren mcgavin of counter attack tries to induce her to resume her heroin usage meanwhile frankie comes home to her invalid wheel chair bound wife zosh eleanor parker of escape from fort bravo who manipulates her with guilt frankie was drunk when she had a car accident and zosh wound up in a wheel chair frankie shows up with high hopes and a drum set but zosh sees no future for her as a musician and urges to go back to work for schwiefka frankie plans to visit a music promoting and one of her own friends sparrow arnold stang of my sister eileen shoplifts a business suit from a department store for frankie after frankie refuses to work for schwiefka because she is going to see musical agent harry lane will wright of the wild one schwiefka turns both frank and sparrow into the police meanwhile schwiefka gets brach s department store to drop the shoplifting charges the suit was worth $3700 frankie agrees to resume dealing for schweifka and the hustler bails her out not long afterward despite her resolution to shun heroin use frankie breaks down and pays louie the $200 for a fix  eventually frankie meets harry lane and lane warns her that she is catches frankie shooting up that she will have nothing to do with her what poor frankie doesn t know is that zosh has recovered her ability to walk but she uses her guilt about the accident to hold on to her zosh is also jealous of her downstairs neighbor molly novotny kim novak of picnic frankie s former sweetheart who hustles drinks at a nearby strip bar called the safari club when zosh complains about headaches that frankie gives her practicing on her drum set frankie moves them downstairs into molly s apartment schwiefka and louie are planning a big poker game with sam markette george e stone of guys and dolls and williams george mathews of gunfight at the ok corral two big time gamblers who have heard about frank and her legendary  golden arm  schwiefka and louie persuade a reluctant frankie to deal for $250 after an early winning streak frankie starts losing and she cannot reverse her bad luck in fact frankie spends about two days dealing exhausted her nerves shot and desperate for a fix she falls apart on the second day and markette and williams catch her cheating louie refuses to give frankie a fix so frankie knocks her out and ransacks her apartment for the heroin preminger pulls no punches in the man with the golden arm and the film is pretty disillusioning none of the characters here are remotely sympathetic essentially they are either hustlers or hustled sinatra gives another dynamite performance as does mcgavin and parker to be sure the man with the golden arm has lost much of its impact in the intervening 50 or more years but it still ranks as a landmark film	1
1433	a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what beingor being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is preminger s way of showing how bleak a junkie s world can become worth a look  an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in	1
1434	just getting released from a six month drug rehabilitation program and having served her time for dealing cards in illegal gambling card games frankie machine frank sinatra has high hopes for going clean and finding a new life as a big band drummer however upon returning to her old crime ridden chicago neighborhood she soon finds the pressure mounting from those around her including her wheelchair ridden wife zosch eleanor parker to return to the old money making dealer lifestyle that first got her started on the path of self destruction that is being an heroin addict it s very rare that a film has so many great character performances as this one does frank sinatra is superb as frankie machine and realistically portrays the symptoms of a drug addict going through withdrawal arguably better than anyone else had ever been done before her sinatra seems to possess a keen understanding and awareness of her character here and expresses the constant battle for control over her own life that is forever going on inside the heart of the man that is frankie machine parker as her crippled wife zosch wants to possess frankie forever to have her deal to make good money so as to take care of her and pay her ever mounting medical bills she seems terrified by anything she sees as a threat to her control over her such as the freedom the life of a drummer might offer or anything that might change the status quo between them onlooker molly kim novak a girl who lives in the same building and seems to possess real strong genuine feelings for frankie having no desire to control her but only to help her proves the best thing frankie has going for her in the world if she can just stay straight long enough to wake up and realize it darren mcgavin as the heroin drug peddler louie however is always there just waiting in the wings knowing just the right buttons to push just the thing to say to get a former addict to revert back to that old habit one profitable to louie but deadly for the addict the setting too seems to take on a life of its own constantly dark gritty seedy and crime ridden with nowhere near enough positive things to look forward to in life a place where it s all too easy to escape via a bottle or drugs a quick fix that s truly no fix at all but only works to keep one in the dark away from the daylight and all the bright prospects the world might have to offer it s a neat touch that when frankie is on the right track the setting always seems brighter than when she s headed down the wrong road while some argue it is a bit dated to me this is a gritty film featuring a realistic inner war within a man for control over her own fate one that features very strong character performances by all involved given that the man with the golden arm gets my highest possible recommendation	1
1435	i saw this movie about 12 years ago and i can still remember it as if i just saw it recently that is how much this movie has affected me considering this is a movie from the 50 s i think it was ahead of its time it surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on one can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days i personally think is was one of frank sinatra s top five performances in the big screen when others are discussing movies dealing with mental illness and or addiction i always recommend the man with the golden arm as one of the top five to watch	1
1436	star rating ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning  one time heroin addict frankie machine frank sinatra gets out of prison to her bumbling jailbird partner sparrow arnold stang needy cripple of a wife zosch eleanor parker and bit on the side molly kim novak she s trying to make it big as a drummer in a band but until her big break comes along she s stuck doing the only other thing she was any good at other than being a junkie  dealing cards in high stakes games and try as she might even prison hasn t cured her of her addiction to the devil s drug  causing her to lie to and deceive all those around her and driving her to desperate measures to feed her habit her yearning to come off it is her only motivation towards a happy ending when people think of frank sinatra they generally think of classic high pitched songs like under my skin new york new york and it had to be you but lest anyone forget she was actually a renowned actor too and if her performance in the acclaimed from here to eternity wasn t enough she will also be remembered for this cutting edge drama dealing with what was at the time the ultra taboo subject of drug abuse the film is often listed as one of the first to feature graphic heroin use probably the reason behind the 15 certificate in a time when it was a subject that was still very much pushed underground in her portrayal of the main protagonist sinatra is fine perfectly conveying the despair desperation and sincerity of a man losing every second chance that is being given to her her cold turkey scene is much more intense than ewan mcgregor s in trainspotting the first co star to make an impression is parker as machine s demanding needy cripple of a wife using her husband s guilt and sense of duty to all the effect she can novak as her secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less of a star than parker stang does her usual comic relief thing as the bumbling sidekick who trails the leading man around with her waspy new york accent director otto preminger does allow the pace to drag a bit sometimes but this is still a powerfully absorbing film all the way with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and which should be admired for being one of the first films to bring such a grim subject so powerfully to life ****	1
1437	the man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic and in some respects the message the tragedy of heroin addiction it s nowhere near a great film but its importance lies in otto preminger s dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism what i liked is that it s not so much an expose of junkies if you want the best expose of that read naked lunch if you can get through it anyway besides the point but the nature of the urban environment frankie machine lives she expects after she gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician but she has her crippled wife zosch who can t work and needs money and often complains and then there s the old neighborhood  she can t escape seeing louie darren mcgavin who is still doing back room card games and yes pushing dope like mean streets it s hard to escape the minutia unless you leave but then again it s hard for frankie machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter it s just that she can t escape the temptation of junk when she s booked on a phony theft charge with her friend she sees a junkie freaking out and it puts back the fear of going back on into her clean self and personifying frankie is sinatra and i can t see anyone else who could ve played her even original choice brando she fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game but there s also a vulnerability to sinatra that she pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see her going  cold turkey  in molly s apartment it s believable even if it s not the kind of thing those from  my  generation would think of heroin ie trainspotting and certainly requiem for a dream if for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to sinatra as this character the flaws however come in some of the other performances though it s a little tricky eleanor parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie fooling frankie that she s really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling her for one reason or another but then it becomes clearer as it goes along  she s supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better meanwhile kim novak is good though not vertigo worthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story then there s a detective bendar who might be one of the most one note characters performances ever and also sparrow frankie s nerdy friend and the characters of louie and schiefka and they re all played as one might expect them to actually mcgavin is better than ok as far as casting other talent around sinatra preminger doesn t do all that great and frankly some scenes kind of fall flat but there s a lot of fascination in the man with the golden arm and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest it works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy it s a genuine article just not exceptional	1
1438	great book great movie great soundtrack frank sinatra shows in this movie that when she wanted to put the effort in she could act the ending is a bit schmaltzy but for the time it s understandable the studio wanted a happy ending the graphic nature of the heroin addiction groundbreaking for the period is a plus add the terrific soundtrack and you ve got one of the great american movies	1
1439	a dark and painful look at the perils of drug addiction sinatra is wonderful in this film just watching her frenzied writhing and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year it s the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new clean life for herself after being in prison trying to rid herself of her drug habit and her job of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations who is pulled down pulled back into the muck by the evils of human nature she is being taken advantage of by her employers the drug dealers and even her enigmatic crafty yet stupid wife  even if you didn t like the film itself it s worth seeing just for the soundtrack it s all heavy swinging jazz with large drum and brass sections this with its groovy yet slightly sinister sound helps set the mood along with the grinning snaky drug and card dealers who always seem to hover like vultures around frankie machine i recommend this to anyone    especially if you like film noir zoot suits fedoras or jazz	1
1440	from the crash of the opening theme the man with the golden arm is classic 1950 s entertainment no subtlety here frank comes home from prison with a monkey on her back and goes right back to the old neighborhood where the old scumbags still lurk this is a tale of her dark ride with all of her emotional baggage intact the performances are all a bit overripe but that s part of the fun of watching darren mcgavin and arnold stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show this and the manchurian candidate are the two greatest chairman of the board films in my humble opinion don t miss either one of them	1
1441	a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what beingor being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is preminger s way of showing how bleak a junkie s world can become worth a look  an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in	1
1442	great little ground breaking movie in 1955 about an important subject i wasn t expecting much from sinatra s performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeous loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein as great as that by lazlo schifrin for bullitt i am very surprised it doesn t seem available on cd if anyone knows about the soundtrack s availability on any other format they should post it here somewhere preminger s direction was as usual borderline flawless haven t read nelson algren s novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself it s very much worth seeing	1
1443	*** spoiler in fifth paragraph *** this was an amazingly frank uh huh uh huh picture for 1955 otto preminger and carlyle productions took a chance by making it the motion picture association of america balked at certifying a film that openly shows a junky jabbing a syringe full of heroin into her arm frank sinatra took a chance both on playing an addicted musician and at falling flat on her face in a role that required at least twice as much acting as she d ever done all in all these gambles paid off the movie is a classic though it s not perfect nelson algren s novel may be great but it has far too much going on to fit comfortably into a two hour movie  the man with the golden arm  is 119 minutes and often feels much longer however in my opinion it s not just frankie machine sinatra that makes the film but the other characters and their sub plots all involving frankie ultimately it s not just frankie who has the addiction everyone and everything seems to be dependent on her and she feels it keenly when the pressure gets to be too much the drums start pounding on the soundtrack and frankie steps across the street with her well dressed friend louie it s an exaggeration to say that frank sinatra s music career was ever really in the doldrums but in the early 50 s she was in limbo between her days touring with big bands and the las vegas era  from here to eternity  established her as a serious actor and her career as a singer rebounded as well but  the man with the golden arm  was still a significant challenge the whole show sinks or swims with her performance she pulls it off with such skill that for several minutes at a time i forgot i was watching frank sinatra she must have known junky musicians and exploited that knowledge to the utmost set side by side with billy wilder s masterpiece  the lost weekend  there is more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in  the man with the golden arm  whereas don birnem ray milland in  the lost weekend  seems to struggle mostly against herself frankie machine is beset by external forces and she takes refuge in the needle neither approach is wholly right or wrong mostly because addiction is impossible to fully explain but it seems like this film might have benefited from a little more insight into frankie s internal struggle *** spoiler *** one of the problems i have with this film is the clich√©d reliance on quitting cold turkey i realize that  the man with the golden arm  was probably setting the trend rather than following it but that doesn t make it any better in the beginning of the movie frankie has to all appearances kicked her habit with the help of a doctor and a treatment facility of some sort naturally the drama of the film requires that she backslide but i found the all american ideal that a man has to face her problems alone or maybe with the help of a good woman out of place here going cold turkey and riding off into the sunset with kim novak seemed too unrealistic the end of  the lost weekend  was similar but in my opinion was a little less rosy	1
1444	lots of scenes and dialogue are flat out goofy but when you add it all up ie machine s daily cycle from depressing walkup to depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall to depressing smoke filled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the junkie s life circa 1955 whether it s sinatra who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in hoboken and working in numerous bands or preminger who uses the soundtrack and the frankie zosch subtext to slip the addict s interior worldview past the hays code cage you get a good companion piece to on the waterfront which was filmed almost exactly the same time sort of a faux realist work that leaves you realistically wondering how deep the drug culture is embedded in american life	1
1445	otto preminger was one of the great maverick film directorslike john huston she was a character from one of her own movieslike mr huston she was a wonderful ham who slipped in and out of performance at random but the final product of her labours was unmistakably her own with a few exceptions films are now made by corporationsnot individualsand as a result are usually highly polished packagesa product in much the same way as a golf balla tin of dog food or a motor car is a productthe involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidentalsuch is the appetite for the product that there appears no end to the line of well finishedglossysuperficially entertaining but ultimately empty films that flood the countless tv channels and movie outletsthere is no time for a man like mr preminger to stand a little apart from the torrent of product and craft a personal work of art of course there has always been the art for art s sake   money for christ s sake ethos in film makingbut now ars gratia artis hasin all but name been consigned to history s cutting room floor today otto preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering pizzas in hollywood half a century agohaving made the hugely influentiallaurawhere the sidewalk ends and the moon is bluehe set about filming nelson algren s controversial novel the man with the golden arm in her eccentric and individualistic mannerrather than take her camera out onto the streets she stayed in the studio and used stylised almost expressionistic setsquirky castingmr frank sinatra   hot from her success in from here to eternitythe younginexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful miss kim novak and mr arnold stanga man whose oddities were after her own heartand a remarkable era   defining score by elmer bernstein featuring the cream of west coast jazzmen an otto preminger film was always an all round experience to be considered as a whole rather than breaking it down into actingdirectingphotographywhat appeared on the screen was preminger s visionhis creation and her interpretation of algren s novel not a film of algren s novelany one of twenty competent hollywood hacks coud have produced that from the first hi hat cymbal beat that accompanies saul bass s iconic title sequence we are drawn into preminger s take on what is nowadays called the lifein truth a murky area occupied by hustlersjunkiescopsdrug dealersstone gamblersjazz musicianstheir women and hangers onthe lines are blurred in the lifeand it s dog eats dog down there the inhabitants circle each other like sharkslooking for a sign of weakness to be exploitedfrankie machinemr sinatraa professional card dealerex junkie and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victimwhen things get tough she goes back to the needlealthough she kicks the habit by going cold turkey there are absolutely no guarantees that she won t go straight back on it further down the line mr sinatra s depiction of an addict in the throes of withdrawal has divided the criticsbut the fact of the matter is that even fifty years later most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life so we don t know how accurate the portrayal iswhen i first saw the film in the late 50s i was very impressedwatching it recently on videoit seemed to put it unkindlyhammyperhaps she is a victim of her own success as many actors subsequently doing cold turkey havewith the passing of the yearstaken her performance and refined it somewhat arnold stang is outstanding as machine s pal sparrowa performance she exceeded only in it s a madmadmadmad world try and watch it on the big screen and view it as the cinematic vision of a true auteura giant amongst today s pygmies   otto preminger	1
1446	frank sinatra has one of her best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to her chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic she plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but she can t avoid running into her old friends she had been arrested originally not for any drug related charge but because she was caught dealing in an illegal poker game her skill at poker has earned her the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being her former heroin connection want her to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom she injured in a car accident zosch eleanor parker and make up with her old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra s mental state when she feels sure of herself at the beginning of the film i felt good for her but when a promised phone call doesn t come one day she descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when she finally gets to audition she arrives completely strung out her embarrassment when she can t play the correct beat is devastating she had such big dreams and the other musicians don t even pay her a bit of attention as she rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows frank s drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernstein s score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don t like about the film is the ending spoilers although i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes zosch s death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and she won t go to jail also her dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there s always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands it s still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10	1
1447	if you like your films to pull your emotions out of you if you like your films with a guy you can root for and relate to if you like your films in black and white you gotta see this film watch it from start to finish because you don t want to miss a beat it is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen then when the plot begins to unfold you will be on the edge of your seat i know i was my mother told me about this film as our family had some of the same things going on in it as the film does we loved frankie who plays the lead convincingly what ever you think about frank sinatra put that aside in the film she is skinny and she doesn t sing so keep an open mind for the era it was made in it tells a story that is still being told today in homes all across the nation and quite possibly the world please watch if you like older films give this one a try	1
1448	frank sinatra took this role chewed it up with the rest of the scenery and   spat it out her way tmwtga is stagey the ending is trite some of the scenes need a little more cutting but that s all it s great entertainment from start to finish and while you watch it you realise that sinatra that long dead mor crooner had junkies gangster card games and the whole us urban hustle thing in her blood   she didn t learn it from an acting coach there are all sorts of directorial touches to keep you amused and the non dated soundtrack cooks all the way the marathon card game beat goodfellas sopranos etc by forty years so it wasn t faithful to the book what movie is and i can t imagine it being remembered if brando had been let loose on it the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing instead of edgy convincing and moving with sinatra no one else has mentioned the seedy lazy cynical cops   absolutely spot on and eleanor parker would have driven *me* to smack	1
1449	i have never been as surprised by a film that was this old only the treasure of the sierra madre holds up this well performance wise as someone that has seen heroin addiction first hand i was shocked at how realistic this film was frank sinatra s performance is completely uncompromising realistic and heart wrenching otto preminger s direction is perfect for the film with long takes and a very mobile camera kim novak s performance is good as is eleanor parker s in fact the entire supporting cast works very well with understated performances as befitting this film s style the documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date highly recommended 80 out of 10	1
1450	i am fifteen years old and have seen thirty three of sinatra s films not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries and have been unimpressed by only two of them   till the clouds roll by and the miracle of the bells don t really count however considering that in the first all she does is sing a magnificent ol  man river and in the latter she s not half bad only the picture is pathetic my favorite records radio shows tv shows and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every day everything taking on a different connotation at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing she ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison when it comes to movies the man with the golden arm heads that list everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows she thought this was her best ever performance she was oscar nominated it was the first serious look at drug addiction etcetc the jazz score is unforgettable kim novak s likable despite a ludicrous accent eleanor parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic the turtle like arnold stang is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out and darren mcgavin makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer the sets are unconvincing   at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an off center charm  then you come to sinatra like everything else in her life   other than music   reports of her acting are alway divided in half directors like fred zinnemann frank capra billy wilder stanley kramer martin scorsese peter bogdanovich and otto preminger all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on her films as she did on singing she d have been among the greatest actors in the world   if not the greatest humphrey bogart even saidthis guy has the most natural acting talent i ve ever seen not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in her life was at the same time producing the discography that would make her the greatest singer of the 20th century and did almost all her scenes in one take  in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and biographies that sniff haughtily about what a lousy actor was this mrsinatra and how many bad movies she made the question will never be answered to everyone s satisfaction because controversy was among sinatra s greatest assets and both arguments were in a sense playing into her hand in any case at this time in this role sinatra is magnificent a reviewer said in the late fiftiessinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world but there is none more fascinating to watch no matter what sinatra is doing in a film it s hard to take your eyes off her this of course is a charisma that i ve only seen in a handful of other people orson welles richard burton marlon brando montgomery clift perhaps james cagney there s no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether you re really enjoying a performance or just spellbound but that quality on display here is what makes the movie sinatra is downright riveting real intense   transcending decades and thousands of paper doll pop stars with something called quality like it or not this is a one man show with a few character actors hanging around in the background she covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety from sweet lonely tenderness with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra frank sinatra whimpering and screaming in the agony of cold turkey sinatra was right   this is her best performance no question  i was eight when frank sinatra died i wasn t around for all the years of bobby soxers and   anchors aweigh   mr ava gardner and   from here to eternity albums with lamp posts and   swingin  lovers kennedy vegas ring a  ding ding basie and mia and reagan and concerts from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the sands i can t say i like sinatra because i heard her at the paramount or because i hear september of my years autobiographically the usual excuses and my excuse when i was eleven i watched a movie called on the town	1
1451	rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the windy city contrarian director otto preminger decided to go the opposite way and make her movie appear as artificial as possible thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like kazan huston and zinnemann who were making their pictures all over the world nelson algren on whose novel the movie is based went on record as despising it what one wonders was preminger up to and why did she do the movie this way the sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a mr magoo cartoon louie the drug pusher is attired as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at mad magazine used to draw arnold stang wonderful comedian that she was seems out of place in a serious picture like this and her very appearance topped off by an exaggerated and over sized baseball cap elicits laughter robert strauss another actor best known for humorous roles is likewise out of place as her large heavily jowled face and runyonesque delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a jerry lewis movie against all this stars frank sinatra kim novak and eleanor parker have to work overtime to just keep the viewer from snickering sinatra is jittery and manic throughout suggesting a man ill at ease with herself hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict miss novak plant like and sublimely deadpan is sympathetic and seems a product of the artfully dingy slums she graces in the film parker is pure hollywood and very hard working as the crippled and crafty zosch she is never convincing but then neither is the film i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in america the caligari sets alone make it unbelievable preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare operetta perhaps harking back to preminger s early days in vienna	1
1452	otto preminger s the man with the golden arm is a reference to heroin addiction   something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955 fifty years ago the censors today still have a problem with drug content in films the lead role was originally offered to marlon brando then snatched by frank sinatra before brando could respond sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find herself battling the demons of temptation preminger is one of my favorite directors her anatomy of a murder starring james stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the  50s   anatomy of a murder was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content references to rape women s panties seduction etc and the man with the golden arm deals with a topic that is equally volatile however preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative this is like a forerunner to the panic in needle park 1971 and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic billy wilder movie lost weekend starring ray milland these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today	1
1453	this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s otto preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them frank sinatra gives her best performance and the music score by elmer bernstein is dynamite from the opening titles by saul bass to the hysteria of drug addict frank going cold turkey this is a riveting movie with kim novak giving a very good performance eleanor parker giving a very bad performance as well as darren mcgavin as the reptilian pusher and arnold stang as frank s grifter pal beware of bad prints this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough	1
1454	i ve always enjoyed frank sinatra s music and just recently i wrote a term paper about her life story i ve been fascinated by the life and legend of ol  blue eyes however i ve never seen any of her movies so i wanted to see if her acting was as great as her singing wellit was i was blown away by her performance in this movie she really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict frankie machine who s trying to put her life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band  otto preminger s direction is great as well i haven t seen any of her other movies i read her biography on the imdb she seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood and people had conflicted thoughts about her seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult enthusiasts i haven t seen enough of her films to know for sure if she s really brilliant but now i m curious i want to see more of her films because judging by her attempt with the man with the golden arm this guy has talent i also loved the music for this movie the score definitely contains the kind of music that i ll remember if i ever happen to hear it again that s when you know you have a great score the supporting performances are fine as well including darren mcgavin as the local drug pusher eleanor parker as frankie s wheelchair bound wife and kim novak as her lover  it s interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like trainspotting and requiem for a dream back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very discreet level there s only one scene where frankie is actually getting heroin injected into her arm and they showed a close up of the reaction of her face rather than showing the needle graphically poking into her veins but it delivered its message without making it feel watered down in a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you don t need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued  the man with the golden arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out it really is an amazing piece of work my score 8 out of 10	1
1455	frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it s hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing she ever did though it would be her performance as frankie machine the heroin  addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally babelicious kim novak the cold turkey scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from saul bass s title graphics to the ground breaking jazz score by elmer bernstein it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s but it s a must see nevertheless	1
1456	the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain but i think of the three this one is the best maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet who knows maybe preminger couldn t get enough money to pay for the location it s the only flaw i find in the film frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for her boss robert strauss when the game was raided she took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people are conspiring against her first bob strauss who wants her back dealing especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town she uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra s services back secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again and finally eleanor parker her clinging wife who s working a con game to beat all just to keep her around frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film but lost to ernest borgnine in marty sinatra might have won for this one if she hadn t won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year her scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak s apartment will leave you shaken eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role she s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody she might have been nominated for this 1955 marked the high point of her career  darren mcgavin got her first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler her performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in not a place you d want to bring up your family	1

1458	we have moved far beyond this tentative foray into a forbidden area drug addiction for the 1950s as such the film may seem dated the man with the golden arm served its function is peeling back a layer of the underside of society an eye opener to a southern country boy in 1955 when i first viewed this film in the theater after some serious consideration about being too young i was allowed to go it was powerful and affecting then and still maintains some sharp painful moments of the soul stripped naked as a movie depicting the loneliness at the core of being it succeeds filled with angst frank sinatra in her best role creates a vulnerability that makes her sympathetic to the viewer she conveys her helplessness and ineffectualness in a beautifully restrained performance as a voice of common sense in the dead end urban jungle kim novak as molly is quite good she is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground the interaction between sinatra and novak is really good darren mcgavin plays a slimy character and does it very well eleanor parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role of the pathetic zosch the crippled wife of sinatra arnold stang is another unlikely survivor of the street regarded as pitiful and despicable her character sparrow provides tart comedic moments  the music is almost the star of this film brooding frenetic moody poignant elmer bernstein s score perfectly accentuates the tensions of frankie machine s spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin molly s theme is bittersweet and captures aurally what the film depicts visually i know of no other soundtrack that effectively complements the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as does this one	1
1459	a group of teens that have broken into a huge department store are attacked by a crazed police man exciting and suspenseful throughout and refreshingly devoid of extreme violence and gore but those aussie hairstyles and accents are a bit much to take and they can induce headaches but this is still a good thriller 7 out of 10	1
1460	there are only a few movies which can be called `must see  and shephered is one of those films in many ways it was ahead of it s time and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better known films copied by many equaled by none this truly is one great movie the story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity the story takes place in a post apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns c thomas howell is a `shepherd  one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society the whole idea made me think about our society it s really a brilliant social commentary which is more than i can say for certain recent sci fi action blockbusters matrix reloaded and revolutions didn t make one feel that any real innovation was taking place just dull video game effects but shepherd scores on the action scale too not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath peter hayman proves herself to be one of the few genius action directors we re talking 100% high grade down home kung fu fighting it was excellent really good special effects shoot outs bleak futuristic cyber punk noir style¬Ö the film really has its own elements when talking about shepherd it s impossible not to mention how much style it has the vision of this city is really stunning it recalls images of tim burton s very memorable vision of gotham in batman and these sights are photographed by graeme mears with a degree of skill that puts gordon willis and conrad hall to shame even the special effects proved amazing doubtless the scenes where fighting occurs are landmarks in all of filmmaking this movie is a ballet of awesome visual display still at the base of it all there lies an interesting story carried through by a strong cast the acting especially rowdy piper and the plot are both great and excellently directed in contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit i m always proud to see a great film like shepherd come along it s a damn shame that it didn t receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office it s a rarity worth searching for this movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler for having seen it	1
1461	this is a very strange series with dean learner i really didn t understand the guests i knew they weren t serious but whether they were really them was unclear becausei guess i m just that stupid i don t know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren t real like in ali g or anything they re played by one man or so i believe i love the serious look that she s got going on its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol i also really like the suit and moustache thing she has got going on its quite hot she s insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities i also like the way she has subsections of the programme it makes it seem more authentic	1
1462	a spin off comedy talk show from the creators of  garth marenghi s darkplace  the new series man to man with dean learner focuses on garth s manager publisher and publicity agent as played by richard ayoade nightclub owner restaurateur publisher international playboy   dean learner is a one man brand  after her co funded channel 4 television hit garth marenghi s darkplace she now invites you into her luxury penthouse flat for an all new entertaining and immensely stylish tv talk show man to man with dean learner will feature all dean s remaining celebrity friends as well as plenty of live music and fine fish dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class   but not fish i attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches there are distinct comparisons to alan partridge s  knowing me knowing you  in the layout but richard ayoade and matt holness s unique writing style take it to another level if your a fan of darkplace then you can t miss it catch it when its aired late this summer	1
1463	after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show on the good episodes as darkplace i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver steve pising pronounced pissing and the great garth marengi to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants she launches into are genius ie her argument with def lepord over their name all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes	1
1464	the first episode of  man to man with dean learner  that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of  garth marenghi s darkplace  and had me at my maisonette hope it keeps up the good work of  faux terribles  on my tv richard ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of alternative comedyi hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one comedians on tv todayi m glad that on a trip of local dvd retailers today garth marenghi s darkplace was sold out across the board even from her brief stint in nathan barley i knew that ayoade was a serious talent and i m sure she would have been great as dixon bainbridge in  the mighty boosh  to continued success in the vein of these programs i also felt it necessary to extend my review in order to secure a place on this public domain	1
1465	the soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts you must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes you must know the story through various other reviews so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie firstly the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities the first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way the second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance you hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latter the second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is irrespective of gender so would you still love your partner if she she were to change her her sex the movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful one but there is one point where the movie fails i wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way that what they feel is love doesn t come across till the end but watch it and post your thoughts on it here	1
1466	a strange relationship between a middle aged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon charlotte and venorica both trapped by their inanimate lives and don t know how to get out of them charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic she has broken up with her aggressive ex husband moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog she s sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother s visiting and the bad relationship with her dad her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine all she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other s lives there are some sparkles between them but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do eventually the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination for us to think about it the director s great work gives me an great impression she handles the development of characters very well the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense also i am so obsessed with the gloomy lights all over the apartment delphic but full of desire two main characters are played by trine dyrholm and david dencik they are amazing in their roles a very impressive performance and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing this swedish indie film is about encountering and change no matter you re homosexual or heterosexual male or female the oddness of life exists everywhere whenever you fall across it you ll be hesitate and bewildered but at least don t be afraid follow your heart and choose the right way	1
1467	this film is a very beautiful and slow film there is nothing hollywood about it it is very danish and the characters are very real it is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme it is really about love that has no gender i would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters the transsexual veronika and charlotte are attracted to each other it is a story about love and life the story pretty much takes place in the two apartments there is almost no background music which makes it seem more real and intense the two actors playing the main characters are great they really make them seem real they are not archetypes but real people you could meet in the street i think it is the first time i have seen a transsexual portrayed this well very well done	1
1468	this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their best of¬Ö week and can also be seen on south park s second season dvd i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary most of which occurs with matt stone trey parker and some other guy in a hot tub it was funny when i saw it in the commercials but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentary overall goin  down to south park is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the series  history going back to when matt and trey came up with the idea in college however there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing it s not as fast paced rapid fire and as lively as the actual south park episodes instead it kind of has a slow dry wit style which at times can be funny but most of the time you re just waiting for something to happen if you get the chance to watch it by all means go for it but i don t think you re really missing much if you never see it my imdb rating 7 10	1
1469	going  down to south park is a 1hr long documentary about south park with interviews with trey parker and matt stone and all the other people who work on south parkthere really isn t much to say it shows the history of south park and what it takes to make one episodeit is basically a behind the scenes of the show it shows the different merchandise that south park has madeit was really comedy central who put it out it also shows the controversy which was caused by south parkit shows plenty of funny clips from the show as wellit s a fairly funny documentaryany fan of south park should check this outyou can find it on youtube 9 10	1
1470	trey parker and matt stone the creators of south park finally get out of their grueling schedule to talk to the cameras while sipping champagne in their hot tub at first when watching this i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when trey said she wasn t going to give her mother any of her money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a mockumentary full of inside jokes this documentary shows everything about south park up until the second season anyways it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording it has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the fabrications give insight into the show clips from both of trey parker s spirit of christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show if you were a south park fan then this should have quenched your thirst for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made now obviously the show has changed but this is still interesting what we have here is an amusing documentary where trey parker especially and matt stone come off as arrogant jerks and that s exactly what they wanted to come off as they may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a 51 minute long insightful joke my rating *** out of **** 51 mins not rated contains language and sexual content	1
1471	well i saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other making off from vh1 too bad than this one it s pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park very interesting stuff it s also funny than this documentary portrays trey and matt like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesn t work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the show it also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode interview with the actors who brings character s voices and much more if you re a fan of south park i highly recommend you this	1
1472	ok when i rented this several years ago i had the worst expectations yes the acting isn t great and the picture itself looks dated but as i sat there a strange thing happened i started to like it the action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump brion james maybe one of the greatest b grade actors next to bruce campbell is great as always the story isn t bad either now i wouldn t rush out and buy it but you won t waste your time at least watching this good b grade post apocalyptic western	1
1473	it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there   i d feel a bit cheated if i had paid ¬£15 for it but at about ¬£150 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth  the film can t quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clich√©s from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is there that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although she only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie favourite bit   for me the punch up on top of the oil refinery   if you look closely you can see the post apocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other get several lagers in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel	1

1475	ah when good actors take on bland material if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed while the situations are very true to life the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion much of the dialog is just plain silly but if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it then you will love this movie sam elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond her usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion she depicts in this film and also in her early fifties in this film she looks fantastic her bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere esai morales does a wonderful job elevating her role as det falon s eager beaver new police partner she could have easily played it as a robin to elliott s batman but instead she breathed a genuineness and passion into this role she makes it work despite some of the lame lines she is given to say paul sorvino is fun to watch she plays the eccentric police captain she seems to know she is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it she makes it fun for us too this movie is very by the numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see her spread her wings and do so much more than she usually is allowed to do	1
1476	sam elliot is brilliant as a tough san francisco detective charlie fallon when her partner is killed while meeting with an informant fallon snaps beats the informant to death and dumps her body in a river the next day fallon is assigned a rookie partner and given the task of investigating the informants murder sam elliot does a good job of portraying a man who tortured by the guilt of her own murderous actions and grief over the death of her partner who may have been involved in police corruption	1
1477	from the start you will like sam elliott s character falon  a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to her partner but too loyal and too revengeful when seeing her partner dead in an alley cause she then kills who she thought to be the assailant before giving her a chance to explain falon is an alcoholic and that tends to sway her from being in self control though she manages to direct her attention towards finding who s really behind her partners death she carries along a rookie as her new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but esai morales does well in accompanying sam elliot though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where morales begins a self approved investigation towards falon she mainly wants to find the answers since fallon isn t letting her in on the whole story and does not like what she finds there is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are which is okay and they are not able to sway falon into joining them leading to a dramatic ending fine acting all the way around with a touch of humor from paul sorvino who is the captain of detectives it s a good movie that will make you want to see it several times so it qualifies as a  must see  and a good addition to a movie collection filmed in san francisco	1
1478	i m rating this pretty high just because of sam elliott i could ve done without the female nudity but i d sit through almost any nonsense in order to see sam strut her stuff she gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms many of which i agree with and it s a joy to see her in a role in which she actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be my boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which ed harris had a hispanic partner in the police sense of the term who was a little overeager to prove herself you can draw your own conclusions on that score but if you like sam you ll like this you could say i m biased but who isn t in some way i d buy this on dvd in a heartbeat	1
1479	a sleeper i had never even heard of this movie until i was channel jumping one night i ve been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie non police critics are rating the movie purely from a critic s point of view and not from a police officer s point of view this is real	1
1480	all the reviewers are making one big mistake this movie was not suppose to be taken seriously it was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it s time if you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can t even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasn t meant for you the low budget here and failure of the beastmaster 1 at the box office grossed under four mil with a nine mil budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day you can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesn t do that for a second in our world dar sees a movie theater that s advertising the beastmaster 2 enough said to paraphrase clint eastwood from dirty harry movies this movie knows it s limitations it s more of a comedy parody then usual adventure soundtrack for the time was also great actors aren t taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young kari wuhrer turns out good  so if you are nostalgic for the 80ies 90ies cheese culture or you liked the first part and don t mind going out on a cheese limb you ll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive dar in the 90ies literarly this is not really the sequel to the first and don t watch it if that s what you want it s more of a what if fantasy sequel as for the why different dimension and not just different time question when in history did we have those tall winged humanoid creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 by the way the movie ends in the zoo because of an attempt at a cheap moneywise big finale it s suppose to be the best place for dar to show all her moves her being the manipulator of animals	1
1481	i liked this movie way too much my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside of corse ironside is just a low rent jack nicholson i guess mike was busy that year with highlander 2 the quickening sadly beastmaster 2 would have been a much better career move it is certainly the best of the beastmaster series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic masters of the universe not only does it star the incomparable mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast specifically the second girl from sliders uncle phil from fresh prince of belair and evil chick from superman 2 it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets beastmaster forever rock n roll	1

1485	the 1990s was a great decade for british sitcom with many popular creations such as one foot in the grave absolutely faboulous the thin blue line the brittas empire and men behaving badly arriving onto tv screens for the first time however mr bean is hands down the greatest sitcom of the 1990s mr bean represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as charlie chaplin and buster keaton for several decades it brings to the audience a single character   mr bean   played to perfection by rowan atkinson many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not mr bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability however i believe this debate is unnecessary because i highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider mr bean in such a context mr bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by herself with no guidance from others some of her methods to approaching day to day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show this is where the humour derives from mr bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability she may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things her own way and naturally some of her methods to completing a single task often result in disaster which we then see mr bean try to resolve sometimes we see mr bean show a mean or petty streak often trying to compete with those around her or play pranks on those least expecting it but no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring unlike most examples of british comedy in the past 30 years mr bean is simple inoffensive harmless u rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy it is for this reason why the tv series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world it is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other tv shows will have come gone and been forgotten some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet i laugh just as much at mr bean s antics now as i did when i first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s rowan atkinson has used her natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time the tv series has to date spawned two spin off movies bean and mr bean s holiday as one familiar with the type of humour shown in the tv series would expect it does not translate to success on the big screen the two movies do little justice to the tv series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes the greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting in both movies the producers take mr bean out of her normal british surroundings into america the first movie and france the second movie as a result the movie characters around mr bean respond differently to her behaviour than their tv series counterparts both movies re use gags from the tv series and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time in the second movie mr bean is shown to be behaving out of character with some aspects of her personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny at various times i found myself thinking that the character i was watching was not mr bean but a pale caricature it is clear that rowan atkinson was not enjoying herself as much as she did in the tv series her heart just wasn t in the performance after the second movie came out she stated publicly that she would not play mr bean again i realise how she felt returning to the tv series each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies my favourite episodes are the first three   these set the high standard that was to continue i consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless to summarise mr bean is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family rowan atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this tv series my recommendation   watch and enjoy but only see the movies if you consider yourself a die hard fan after seeing the tv series	1
1486	because mr bean almost never speaks i heartily recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding her finger over the pause play button at the end of any age group s lesson simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the dvd encouraging students to shout out the answers to what s this what will happen what s happening what s wrong or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson s new vocabulary and grammar because everyone s looking at the tv normally shy students become vocal because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point it s a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arriving i tried other dvds notably tom & jerry cartoons and red skelton dvds but no others were as good as mister bean at holding students  constant attention	1
1487	this tv series is about a foolish and unconventional english gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps i remember watching mr bean with my family back in 1990 when i was still a child my family laughed so hard at every episode and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later the memorable scenes which are still in my head include mr bean attempting to get out of her car park shooting out the lights counting sheep and her in the swimming pool we bought all the mr bean videos on vhs no mater how expensive they were it was worth it because we watched them over and over again it is so rare to see a very funny tv series that is suitable for all ages	1
1488	mr bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy she has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit a massive budget a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant and mr bean is one of those characters who you just can t forget some of these episodes had me in stitches   yes they re not realistic at all and they re all pretty stupid but to be honest realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness rowan atkinson and co always manage to cook up interesting new ideas   and hilarious new gags   remember when mr bean drove her green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof mr bean is one of those things that never gets weak   the movie wasn t as good as this but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor extras and little britain can be damned   this is british comedy at its best and most original these escapades never get old 10 10	1
1489	mr bean has always been my favorite no matte how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive mr bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn t need to even speak to make people laugh her gestures her facial expressions and her face itself is so funny to watch the situations which she faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way she handles them is even greater there is simply no reason why this show shouldn t receive a 10 because it is fabulous its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 when mr bean lodges at a hotel 2 the one where she watches the scary film 3 mind the baby  the diaper scene especially in fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show mrbean can go to any heights to prove that she is funny including completely stripping herself in one of the episodes the way she handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10	1
1490	rowan atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless mr bean who never goes far without her teddy bear the appeal of mr bean is largely her childish behavior and innocence we don t know if she came from the sky or another planet she is the kind of strange character that you can t make up quite easily she is often alone and used to it she has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear her grunts at times there are other characters who speak to her and she responds the character of mr bean is a mystery and still is she lives alone and does the unthinkable when she can do the sensible thing mr bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much she rather live a simple life with her yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time	1
1491	rowan atkinson s mr bean ranks right up there with laurel & hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy greats i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i ll never forget the first time my brother saw her she was over for a visit and i asked her if she d ever seen mr bean who she said so i got out my video and showed her the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard she fell out of the chair and was holding her stomach from laughing so hard she became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh  til it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist appointment the christmas episode a classicplus kids love it and the new year party rowan atkinson is a comic genius	1
1492	rowan atkinson s creation mrbean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mrbean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashionthe mistake prone mrbean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situationsthough she barely spoke any coherent words her jovial actions more than made up for this even when driving in her beloved mini mrbean still manages to cause inadvertent chaosnot very much is known about her background but her ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at her funny shenanigans is well known before she found fame nick hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes	1
1493	this is a wonderful family sitcom rowan atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms the thin blue line better than this and blackadder not better than this mr bean is a no talking human disaster she goes to places and gets herself in absolute mayhem the mayhem includes climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off taking about 20 minutes until some kids eventually throw her off ending up inside a washing machine and driving her car while sat on a roof bean drives a mini and has a teddy this was quite similar to the baldy man a series staring gregor fisher who says very little but gets herself in mayhem best episode do it yourself mr bean episode 9 bean hosts a new years eve party then gets some stuff for decorating her flat but has too much stuff and has to drive her car on the roof	1
1494	the last time i laughed this much it s a testament to the talent of rowan atkinson that she has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality   without hardly ever speaking a word the whole success of the program rests on atkinson s shoulders but she carries it with ease despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber faced social  tard so great is the talent and effort put into the performance at times exasperating at times lovable mr bean is an innocent unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate the brilliance of this character cannot be put into words you have to see for yourself the show gets almost too depressing at times like in the infamous new year s eve sketch or when bean celebrates her birthday by going alone to a restaurant offering herself a congratulatory card signed by herself and being served a stake she doesn t quite fancy still there are times when you can t help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which bean gets herself out of trouble like when she disposes of said stake in numerous clever ish ways or when she changes into swimming trunks without taking her trousers off first whatever your reaction to bean and her unorthodox lifestyle you re bound to throw fits of laughter while watching  finally i d like to point out that although bean is classified as a program for children it is just as enjoyable for any grown up with a sense of humour because the more adult jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick yes there is such a thing is funny no matter what age you are bean is the truest definition of a family show this is justly a classic and it always brightens up my day	1
1495	mr bean starring the legendary rowan atkinson was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s and i probably first saw it when i was around ten shortly after it ended so i was seeing reruns i certainly wasn t much of a fan at the time and didn t see too many episodes i didn t really get into the show until my late teens just a few years ago which was when i finally watched every episode unlike before it made me laugh many times and since then that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes  mr bean is a mysterious self centred antisocial extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is her teddy she is pretty much isolated from society and life is not easy for her as she constantly struggles with very simple things this is because she lacks some fairly basic knowledge and has the mind of a child she finds herself in various kinds of trouble wherever she goes and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems she faces not only does she often cause trouble for herself but sometimes for other people as well which she often doesn t tend to realize in other words mr bean is a walking disaster  the humour in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue the gags are almost always sight gags which is mostly what the show is about while there may be an occasional lacklustre gag i would say the vast majority of them are funny often hilarious there are so many highlights while mr bean is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made it s still great for many of those who like visual humour and due to the very limited dialogue you don t even have to speak fluent english to enjoy the show which is why it has received such a world wide reputation the show ran for a few years but the episodes were made very gradually so only fourteen were made in total nonetheless it is a classic series and deserves its wide appeal	1
1496	mr bean was great fun i loved it every episode was really funny rowan atkinson was perfect for this role she s a funny looking bloke and her facial expressions were hilarious  the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in 1997 which was also pretty funny by the way  it s funny seeing all the adventures and situations she gets herself into this series was a classic for sure and i still watch an episode from time to time mr bean is well worth a 10 10 in my book fans of offbeat comedy must check this out	1
1497	star rating ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning  mr bean rowan atkinson is in this world but not of this world her mind simply doesn t seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and her life is one long disaster because of this getting herself into constant mishaps and far out zany situations which she is left to sort out on her own as she doesn t seem to mix with anyone and she rarely speaks but she never gives up and despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for her applying her own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for her in the end to look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all it s focus of sex and general vulgarity you d be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time there s nothing unsuitable going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the 50s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as i did when i was a young boy in the early 90s although i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why she does things the way she does and things seem to keep going wrong for her as others have noted it looks like she may have a type of autism in fact i m so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to analyse her i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be diagnosed with something like asperger s syndrome if you d like to see some truly hilarious british humour at it s very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because it s well realised but it s really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and civilised once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon *****	1
1498	hearkening back to those good old days of 1971 we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema that s what the promotional guy called it when we saw her on somebody s old talk show we can t recall just whose it was either merv griffin or woody woodbury one or the other the guest talked about sir charles  career and how her films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former little tramp  from los estados unidos on the grounds of her being an undesirable alien no schultz she s not from another planet  charlie had been deemed to be a  subversive  due to her interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems everything from the anarchist movement from the  20s and before the technocracy craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplin s hollywood parties which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style which we commonly call communism compounding mr chaplin s predicament was both confounded by one little detail she had never become an american citizen anyhow enough of this background already  suffice it to say that she had become  persona non gratis  in the united states of america it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses it d sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting americanos it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist besides the academy of motion pictures arts & sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the 1972 oscar show this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have her come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world wide television audience numbering in the millions  besides that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre remember the little tramp was as astute as a bu$ine$$ man as she was as a film maker the program consisted of showings of modern times city lights the great dictator monseur verdoux a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest in our fair city of chicago it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public s desire to view each picture as we recall the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revue in retrospect we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers much like ourselves who knew very little about her accomplishments in motion pictures except for those keystone essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so so many kiddy shows all over the country oh well once again no one consulted me concentrating on today s honored guest film the chaplin revue we found that it was actually three separate pictures carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin herself some lively themes and incidental music once again written by chaplin and some happy talk and serious narration ditto by chaplin she opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time showing director chaplin demonstrating just what she wants to a group of actors this segment was well done and well received by the audience both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated the rehearsal naturally the building by use of speeding up the camera s photographic process the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplin s short comedies from her stint with first national pictures roughly that being 1917 to 1923 the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood first up was shoulder arms charles chaplin productions first national pictures 1918 as the title suggests it is a tale of world war i released in october of 1918 with about a month to go before the armistice day of november 11 it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl miss edna purviance the levity is fast physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy the german army displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together the next film a dog s life chaplin productions first national 1918 traces the parallel lives of chaplin s tramp and a newly adopted stray scraps the movie story involves families two of them one homo sapiens one canine and both supplying us with some big surprises as the finale we have the pilgrim chaplin first national 1923 was a good choice to have as the finale it was bright light and tight it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team the pilgrim in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety but rather a dude or tenderfoot who has ventured out west the tramp is not only that guy but her character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western town s church our rating that is schultz and me is **** that s four derbies poodle schnitz	1
1499	most of chaplin s most famous films are her full length features and i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of her from her pre feature days when she starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts this is really a shame as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplin s better shorts because chaplin herself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film this is great for several reasons first in chaplin s earliest films from 1914 1915 her character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether plus even when she is there she was often mean spirited and self centered  something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love second because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition if you watch this film you won t need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn t fit the action a common problem so for a great look at chaplin s shorts at their finest give this film a chance it s sure to provide you some excellent laughs	1
1500	the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either chaplin s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done the problem with this compilation is a minor one yet annoying the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the 24 frame ps speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames ps this results is jerky motion that doesn t look very attractive and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time it s just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed there are separate restored versions of these classics available even on dvd and it would not be a problem to restore the image but alas this has not been done a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating the shorts are still worth  10 	1
1501	in the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled flicker flashbacks in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of mary pickford and blanche sweet were played for laughs scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged projected too fast and given an overlay of jangly music and lame quips the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up mid century hollywood s view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey florid a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle during the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons james agee s famous 1949 essay on the silent clowns for life magazine was a factor but television played a major role in reacquainting viewers with silent movies admittedly the tv networks sometimes handled the material as crudely as the flicker flashbacks people but higher toned series such as silents please treated the films with respect another milestone was robert youngson s compilation feature the golden age of comedy which proved to be something of a surprise hit when it was released to theaters late in 1957 i don t know if charles chaplin was aware of youngson s film or its success at the box office but it was around this time that she decided to launch a theatrical re release of three of her best short comedies a dog s life shoulder arms both made in 1918 and the pilgrim made in 1922 and released the following year these three movies happened to work well as a trio since they contrast nicely in plot theme and setting in addition all three feature familiar faces from chaplin s stock company some of whom play multiple roles in each short at the time of the re release the films hadn t been publicly screened in over thirty years so perhaps chaplin was concerned about maintaining her reputation with a new generation of movie goers especially since her best work was seldom shown on television in the new medium s early days unfortunately chaplin apparently concluded that the films moved too quickly at the old silent projection speed so the decision was made to stretch print them which meant that every other frame was printed twice maybe she wanted to avoid the  flicker flashbacks  look but this wasn t the best way to go about it aesthetically speaking the results were awful and practically destroyed the movies  flow of action but nonetheless that s how the chaplin revue was released to theaters in 1959 and that s the version that was transferred to video and made commercially available by playhouse video in the 1980s i purchased a vhs copy of the movie at the time and was terribly disappointed with the jerky stop and start rhythm of the films it s a particular pleasure to find that david shepard s restoration of chaplin s compilation originally produced for the laser disc format is a vast improvement over the playhouse video version for the most part the projection speed has been corrected the stretch printing is gone at any rate though the action seems to drag a bit at times for example in a dog s life during edna & charlie s awkward dance in the green lantern cafe edna s bare arms appear visibly blurred at another point during the trench scene in shoulder arms when charlie is relieved from sentry duty the action appears oddly slowed down for a few moments but this may be the result of a maneuver by the film restorers to cover a bit of decomposition over all picture quality is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves other bonuses the revue begins with rare behind the scenes footage taken at the chaplin studio this includes shots of an obviously staged jokey rehearsal session where chaplin throttles diminutive actor loyal underwood as well as scenes of charlie at her dressing table putting on her makeup and trimming the famous mustache these scenes are accompanied by chaplin s narration delivered at a rapid clip chaplin also composed a new musical score for the compilation and in my opinion her themes for the revue rank with her best compositions especially the pieces used during the caf√© sequence in a dog s life the only exception is the song written for the pilgrim a pseudo singin  cowboy number called bound for texas sung  fifties style by matt monro sounding rather like gene autry which is distractingly anachronistic and out of place otherwise throughout the rest of the revue the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere it feels as though the image release of the chaplin revue is in a sense its long postponed debut presenting these classic comedies the way they were meant to be seen all along in this form the revue ranks with chaplin s most durable and enjoyable works	1
1502	this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in itwho cares about the plot or the actingthis is an italian horror movie people so you know you can t expect much from the acting or the ploteverybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this onesince i never seen any of the movies that she took footage from it didn t matter to methe italian godfather of gore out done herself with this moviethis is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever seeno gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collectionbuy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true	1
1503	i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i ve ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci herself the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the filmwho is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things she s put down in film over the past many years she goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells her that she will believe herself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a fcking moron and some of fulci s hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci   nasty and strong with some really decent scenes the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy lots of stabbings gougings and other cool kill scenes make this one a pretty non stop bloodbath the ridiculous dialog lick itlick it as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy the opera singing slap fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind make this one fun as hell not nearly as dark as some of fulci s other films   cat is more of a self indulgent horror comedy that if it wasn t meant to be funny is actually kind of sad i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time this is the feel good movie of the summerrecommended 8 10	1
1504	this is an interesting movie i think it s very humorous although the humor is very black fulci is good and funny acting herself it s a really funny and truly crazy self portrait of an artist i make horror films if i would make love films no one would buy tickets and it s really sexy movie also almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girls women maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies art in the first place it s a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen a little drunk or some similar state of mind there is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because it s lucio fulci as a matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting anyway it s one of the three best and most complete fulci films i ve seen the others are house by the cemetery & zombihaven t seen the beyond actually the script is overally to my opinion quite ingenious you could see this movie as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder fashionable words the character has a compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts especially crimes she hasn t even done and she questions herself all the time what if i have done it what if i want to do it have i done it do i want to do it she overreacts and exaggerates her thoughts i m sure fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in her house by the cemetery movie for example there is a character named freudstein this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did i also like the simplicity of the photography pictures in this film only thing that disturbs me a little bit is the sadism especially towards women i don t quite understand why is it entertainment is it art is it horror anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre for the others it may be too much	1
1505	lucio fulci was one of the most prolific italian directors by the time of her death in 1996 yet her career had long since descended into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of her earlier work for much of the  70s into the mid  80s she cranked out such stylistically distinctive horrors as city of the living dead the beyond and the brutal giallo the new york ripper fondly remembered by fans like myself and while cat in the brain falls in with the era of fulci s decline as a filmmaker it is a shocking darkly hilarious headtrip that while a clearly inferior work the framing effects and acting are below par proves an interesting open ended meditation on pop psychology and film s ability to desensitize make no mistake cat in the brain is a total gorefest and as disjointed as fulci s previous films but it deserves credit for trying to be something more in a deliciously tongue in cheek touch fulci plays herself a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perverse murderous hallucinations after visiting a shrink who puts her under hypnosis her dreams and reality begin to intersect to the point where the viewer cannot discern the two the recent dvd from grindhouse releasing mentions cat as an heir apparent to the likes of eraserhead and it does carry a similarly disquieting awkwardly funny quality associated with the best surrealist art	1
1506	fulci does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made answer yes cat in the brain also known as nightmare concert is fulci s last masterpiece yes it is no matter what some people will say about it there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci s movies fulci make a fun of herself and her movies with this one lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci herself who plays well horror splatter gore director who thinks she is slowly going insane it s filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here being fulci flick you need to know it s gory how much well pretty much i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me it s a hard to archive even the braindead didn t stop it citb is all about gore almost every scene revolves about fulci who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to her or everything she sees some of the scenes involves her accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that she sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from it s wounds forget the beyond or zombie 2 this is the goriest fulci movie now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie she is such a brilliant director some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where fulci says making gore movies is kind of a sickness ending is very good considering that fulci and most of the italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes if you are fun of the fulci make sure you check it out if you have a weak stomach avoid this and repeat its only a movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being putted in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face	1
1507	in the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like vestron and media effectively shut off italian horror films for much of it s american audience coincidently italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability occasionally movies like primal rage sequels like beyond the door iii troll 2 and a few dario argento films limped out onto video but most remained unreleased until dvd in the us for nearly a decade or longer movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans of these films cat in the brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the legions of lucio fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol fulci herself though not quite fulci s best it s still better than most of her later efforts her rabid fan base will probably love it italian horror and giallo aficionados might also enjoy it depending on their tastes but i m not sure about anyone else people who only watch hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here one thing i personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably benito mussolini s only lasting contribution to italy cinecitta studios the name is instantly recognizable to any fan of italian movies until i saw it here i could only imagine what it looked like	1
1508	the one who says that lucio fulci is not one of the most important names in the history of splatter is probably madthe italian director is a legend among hardcore horror fansand her work exceeds the barriers of the genrewho can forgot her westerncrime or fantasy flicksthis is probably her goriest filmand unfortunately one the lasta horror directorfulci as herself starts hallucinating about gruesome murdershe goes to a psychiatristwho makes her believe she is the criminalin this timethe doctor begins a long chain of serial crimeswith such a plotthe movie should have been filled with somethingand there are roting corpsescrashed or melted headsstabbingsdecapitationschainsaw dismemberment and many otherskind of boring sometimesthe film is saved by the excessive violence that will definitely please the gore addicts	1
1509	i couldn t help but relish the entire premise of cat in the brain because it dutifully explains a director s steadily going mad seeing people murdered from past movies she has made even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past director fulci playing herself is directing ghosts of sodomand can not seem to deprive her mental well being from constant murder she seeks help from a psychiatrist who instead uses fulci s work as a method to execute a series of innocent people hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps she s responsible this is obviously a film playfully poking fun at fulci s image while exploring the themes of how such a profession which produces so much death and destruction rarely untamed could mold and shape a legacy the film features pretty much a wrap around story surrounding non stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail this has a shower murder hitchcock never could direct or probably want to the film s savagery compliments the mental state of fulci s fulcii knowduring the running time reality and cinematic fiction have fused and fulci can find no escape the endingexplaining the old clich√©it s only a moviecouldn t work any better than it does here fulci s boat says perversionexcellent touchand she sails offi can only wish this was her final film because that s a perfect close if there ever was one david l thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill her adulterous wife jeoffrey kennedy is a cop fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend the ultra violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest a scythe a chainsaw and hatchet the most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieceshow a gardener s chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequencethe most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated the opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away feasting on fulci s brain is a howler the scenes which are spliced within the film featuring a horrified fulci looking on are obvious but i couldn t help but enjoy this anyway	1
1510	un gatto nel cervello or nightmare concert as it s more commonly know amongst english speaking audiences starts as horror film director lucio fulci played by the man herself lucio fulci goes to lunch after filming a very gory & violent scene however she orders steak & has a horrible vision relating to cannibalism the grotesque visions hallucinations & dreams continue & begin to affect her mental state fulci decides to seek help & contacts professor egon schwarz dvid l thompson for psychiatric help schwarz claims that fulci cannot separate fantasy from reality & agrees to help her however schwarz has a more sinister ulterior motive as a serial killer starts to brutally kill prostitutes & fulci thinks she might be responsible this italian production was co written & directed by lucio fulci who also stars in the film as a horror film director named lucio fulci which doesn t really feel like a lot of effort went into it anyway un gatto nel cervello is gory if nothing else & for that alone i rather liked it the script by fulci john fitzsimmons giovanni simonelli & antonio tentori is nothing more than a threadbare excuse to edit together lots of gory footage from other italian films it serves it s purpose well enough i suppose & to see fulci on screen has a certain fascination if your a fan of her or are familiar with her films the ending is very rushed almost as if they ran out of money as it just has a policeman telling fulci they killed the killer & that s it another thing about that ending when the two cops put the white sheet over the dead killer in the field & then they walk away leaving it there without any other police presence i mean would the police in italy just leave a dead body in the middle of a field on it s own it moves along at a good pace & if you like your gore then you have to see this although if you don t like gore then you ll hate it with a passion it all depends on your disposition so the choice folks is yours director fulci was never the most artistically adept filmmaker & it shows here as her footage is bland flat & looks like it was shot for tv the footage from the other films 7 in total doesn t match the stuff fulci shot & it is obvious that this has been pieced together from different films if your looking for gore you ve hit the jackpot people are dismembered with chainsaws put through meat grinders faces are melted there are a few decapitations there are some slit throats someones body is gorily crushed under a car a tongue is ripped out someone has their throat crushed as a wheelchair runs over it there are loads of stabbings someone has their guts removed with a hook there s a rotten corpse complete with maggots someone hand is cut off someone has their head bashed in & their eye falls out a gory death by piano wire as it slices through someones throat there are loads of severed limbs gallons of blood splashed around & a scene of some cats eating brains & there s more as well having said that some of the special effects are a bit fake & look cheesy with a supposed budget of around $100000 it shows this is pretty cheap looking it has no visual style or artistic merit but then again why would you want those when you can see a nazi orgy sequence & wall to wall gore the acting in this is terrible including fulci un gatto nel cervello is a top film if your a gore hound like me however if your looking for something with a little bit more substance or indeed any substance then this ones not for you this is the sort of film which divides people straight down the middle you ll either love what it does or hate it	1
1511	cat in the brain is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview describing director lucio fulci s most notorious years of film making the movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life fulci goes further than that she casts herself as the star the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore cat in the brain is not about presenting a clear story and following it instead it pokes fun at some of the clich√©s that have been surrounding the horror genre for years lucio fulci plays herself as a horror director struggling to keep her humanity intact years of violent film making have finally began to reach her it starts slowly steaks and meat in general begin to disgust her her colleagues assure fulci that all she needs is some rest but that doesn t help and soon the grotesque ideas for her movies begin to overwhelm her daily thoughts in an attempt to find a cure for her dangerously maddening mental state lucio starts going to the local psychiatrist unfortunately that does more wrong than good and fulci is thrown into an even bigger mess as the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath who mimics the murders from fulci s films in real life the film retains all the trademarks of italian splatter cinema good or bad they are all here so any comments about the acting or the technical aspects and budget constrains are quite irrelevant as to the quality of the film it is a visual experience no doubts about it fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence easily surpassing pretty much everything she s made amputated by chainsaw limbs cannibalism child murder decapitation these are just some of the many grotesque acts witnessed in cat in the brain some of them are obviously recycled from a few the director s less profile movies but they don t stand out of the context and actually feel quite at home here as i noted before the movie exists much better as a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece the way some of the violence is presented does help establish that idea such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by the reality in the film as they are revealed to be actually scenes inside a movie that fulci s character is directing this sort of film in film presentation lessens somewhat the impact of the gore but in no way does it make it an easy to watch film oh no this is far beyond and above the levels of gore found in mainstream horror and gorehounds will in no doubt be satisfied with that fact lucio fulci was a very polarized figure people either hate her work or love it cat in the brain won t convince any of fulci s detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of her filmography one that fans should really check out	1
1512	fulci is one of my all time favorite italian splatter directors she is also a very good story teller mixing horror the supernatural and psychedelic themes altogether very well this film was truly her last great story before she directed such disappointments as voices from beyond the story is simple as fulci plays herself a horror director after years of filming splatter and gore films it seems that fulci starts to suffer a breakdown in which she starts hallucinating about people being slaughtered she decides to see a psychiatrist who only makes matters worse when she convinces fulci that she is killing people fulci used gore scenes from several pictures around the same time these films i don t believe she directed but certainly produced some of those films are massacre directed by andrea bianchi burial ground touch of death directed by fulci the murders secret and i can t remember the rest of the films nightmare concert is a very underrated film even by fulci fans but i loved this movie and have watched it many times already it is sad that fulci didn t get a chance to direct anything worth while after this but nonetheless this is a great film and i do recommend it to any fulci fan whether you like it or not 9 10 stars	1
1513	un gatto nel cervello cat in the brain is one of the goriest horror movies ever madethere is a lot of blood and goreincluding chainsaw butcherybloody stabbings and numerous decapitationsthe film is also interesting as self parody of fulcibut the gore and violence is the key element in itsome of the gore fx were taken from own fulci s movies quando alice ruppe lo specchio and i fantasmi di sodomaboth 1988plus gore fx taken from fulci supervised the snake house aka bloody psycho by leandro lucchettimassacre by andrea bianchinon avere paura della zia marta by mario bianchinon si sevizia i bambini by giovanni simonelli and luna di sangue aka fuga dalla morte by enzo milioniall 1989the scene where brett halsey beats the woman s face to pulp is from quando alice ruppe lo specchioa film fulci had made for italian tv in 1988the chainsawing of the female corpse at the beginning is taken from the same filmas is the head in the microwave and the guy that gets driven over and over againhighly recommendedespecially if you like extreme cinema	1
1514	lucio fulci s cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a director s decent into madness the director in question is fulci herself who stars in the film fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as  the godfather of gore  and for good reason as she has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like  zombi 2  to a man been hacked to death with chains in  the beyond  all the way to the full on gore fest known as  the new york ripper  if you want gore and let s face it who doesn t fulci is your man however all this catering for gorehounds like you and i has taken its toll on fulci s mental state and she s quickly delving into madness brought about by what she films fulci s problems don t end at her mental state either as her psychiatrist that she has gone to see about her problem has took it upon herself to take up murder as a hobby using fulci s films as blueprints for the murders i ve got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious there is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it s only fit to be laughed at for both it s acting and it s stupidity fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously she s not an actor and it shows but her performance is actually the best in the film it s even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an italian horror film of course nobody goes into an italian horror expecting good acting so it s somewhat forgivable but i do think that fulci could have hired some better ones bad dubbing doesn t exactly help either however something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is counterbalanced by lots of gore and it s extreme to say the least people get their heads cut off a woman is slain in the shower and unlike psycho here we really see it people are hacked up fed to pigs and there s lots and lots of cinema s finest melee weapon   the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end the amount of gore is massively over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a  spoof  feel but cat in the brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway it would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie her name is mentioned often and she s on screen nearly all the time it s not too much unlike  new nightmare  in the ego stakes but it s obvious she had a good time making this and i for one had fun watching it so we can forgive her a little egotism the film s ending lets it down   i saw it coming a mile off but then didn t seriously think that the movie would take that route but i was wrong it did unfortunately the ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes however despite it s ending and terrible acting cat in the brain is a lot of fun and will please fulci enthusiasts no end and it is therefore recommended	1
1515	well this is newfamous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director calledlucio fulci after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and she often hallucinates about committing violent murders she quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom even the dedicated psychiatrist can t seem to keep fulci on the right track now when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value cat in the brain certainly is one of fulci s most pleasant films the gore is overpowering and copious to say the least the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version referred to with the akanightmare concert decapitations all around victims   intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon since it s so exaggerated and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there s beer in the fridge of course from a more professional viewpoint this production can t exactly be called a masterpiece there s not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty headed in order to make more room for the gore characters are just being introduced for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death especially compared with fulci s highlights   like the beyond or don t torture a duckling   this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack the best way to interpret cat in the brain is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship perhaps after seeing so many of her films ¬ñ especially the latter ones ¬ñ being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo artistic critics she wanted to avenge herself by delivering a gory mess that simply can t be cut if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make up effects you only got about 10 minutes of footage left especially because the insane killings re occur later in the film as fulci hallucinates about them again you can almost hear our director think stuff like let s see how you re going to censor this now even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives are there any police officers looking for clues that ll lead them to the killer you don t know and lucio doesn t bother to inform you about that because that would lead to sequences that don t require cutting oh and it s pretty damn pretentious as well the name mr fulci or even lucio is mentioned every 3 minutes 34 times throughout the entire movie to be exact and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change hey i certainly don t blame himafter over 30 years of delivering amusing movies she deserved to have a little extra fun you re a god mr fulci	1
1516	i don t know what it is exactly but the film is happily sitting on my shelf with no thought of ever leaving mefulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous bizzare cheez infested and well unique movies i ve ever seen not sure what else to say about it but i love this movie the steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilariousi m not sure what fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film fulci accused wes craven of ripping her off with scream cat in the brain is a must for bad movie lovers everywhereyes i ll definitely say it s not a good film but i guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever this is an exercise in craziness peoplei guess if i were a serious critic i d give it a 3 but on sheer enjoyability again i can t really explain my affections i d give it a 7really whacked out flick	1
1517	this film with only two characters takes you closer to these two people the interrogator and the prisoner than most films take you to any character however well crafted the sheer confusion terror and pain which madeleine stowe s character undergoes is deeply disturbing as is alan rickman s sadistic yet charming interrogator this film is all too possible and builds to a shocking climax the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting in silence at the end it ll haunt you for a long time	1
1518	simply beautiful one of the best mind   umm screws    in existence both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens  book writer who   maybe   has written a subversive tract moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman five out of five stars and at present 1 20 2000 #2 on my top 100 films of all time list	1
1519	this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterwardgranted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be but i thought this was amazingly well acted and a powerful creation if lacking a little subtlety in exectution i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick i am also a great fan of alan rickman so that might be my bias personally i found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing    this could in fact be anywhere and probably is i say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and likely for anyone involved in any sort of political activity	1
1520	closet land is not at happy movie neither is it connected to any kind of social realism this is perhaps its strength the distance from specific time and nations strengthens the message makes it more powerful and rips away the burden of nationalism and propaganda you often sense in movies made to criticize nations in opposit of ones own i am of course primarily speaking of the usa propaganda in some commercial film bit closet land is so much more than a message it is a film of pure surrealistic beauty filled with the same clean clinical form you find in work such as 1984 and it s equals i am of old a big fan of alan rickman the man with the golden sarcasm and i might add the uncomparable sex appeal   the outplay between her and madeleine stowe is brilliant everytime i see her she seems to play a character even nastier than the last one but enough sweettalk the film lacks in action i dont want any crashing cars but i want something to happen except pure talk after an hour i got really tired of the interrogationroom the predictable actions and more than anything i wanted a more complex view of it all the world the former lives of the characters and all the rest of the framework that was missing for some people a nice touch for me something less positive anyway closet land is a movie worth it s time if you are ready to make a trip into the abyss of the human nature and of course for us who really loves the always evil alan rickman	1
1521	closet land is an amazing terrifying piece of cinema it features only two actors in a single set but never loses your attention the set design is imaginative and troubling the staging of scenes maintains your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror the acting is outstanding with alan rickman and madeleine stowe having the duty of carrying every scene i first saw this film in 1991 soon after it came out on video it didn t play in theaters where i lived not surprising given its political content it should be seen though it features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens the country is never named which makes it all the more striking it could be anywhere east west 3rd world 1st world it illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone when government becomes the ruler of the citizens rather than the servant madeleine stowe is a children s author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture she finds herself in a room with alan rickman a seemingly pleasant functionary at first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go but fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates she is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture the interrogator uses sensory deprivation temporal manipulation confusion auditory manipulation role play and twisted logic to break down the author she is humiliated and browbeaten forced to endure strenuous bodily positions deprived of food and water through it all she refuses to give in to do what the interrogator asks she is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession a simple little act she refuses through it all she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood it is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse to survive she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse these mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator she starts attacking her own beliefs and profession forcing her to examine her own life and motives in the end she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought the interrogator is the one trapped by the state this movie was made during the height of the cold war apartheid and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news it is even more timely in a world where enemy combatants are held and interrogated in secret prisons denied legal rights or counsel where ethnic cleansing lays waste to whole societies and humanitarian aid is denied it demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror	1
1522	i caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me this was one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next alan rickman is an excellent bad guy but this character beats all others i ve never been so affected by a movie it s been 6 years and i still can t forget closet land	1
1523	this is the most difficult movie i have ever seenthe emotional content is horrific yet unforgetable a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning the whole movie revolves around her interrogation alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances	1
1524	the film deals with universal themes mentioning no specific country as its context it could happen anywhere  and has in substance if not form those concerned about 1st amendment issues censorship et al  but don t want to be bored with lectures  need art such as this to illustrate dramatize teach inspire rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor she shines in this film showing off multiple acting talents that you must see i have yet to see her give a bad performance though even in not so great films stowe gives perhaps her best performance and proves that she possesses one of the most striking pair of eyes in hollywood  in two words stunning convincing the set design perfectly matches the situation in function and mood the sound editing heightens to appropriate effect the total contrast conveyed through the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device and the welcome and only respite to the bulk of the story s necessary venue the script is tight and essential with engagingly dramatic yet realistic dialogue ie as it might be and ought to be perhaps the most amazing aspect to contend with is the fact that 1 this is the director s first time out and 2 she is the writer in one phrase a tour de force  with three recommendations see it own a copy see it repeatedly to fathom all its secrets and grasp all it genius	1
1525	this little two person movie is actually much bigger than it looks it has so many layers i ve watched it over and over and always pick up on something new i am amazed at the depth of the acting and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star	1
1526	the good news the director is reportedly committed to the cause of amnesty international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites the not so good news  original  is not everybody s buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores also noted critics like mr maltin and roger ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form if i remember correctly the title is taken from the fairy tale stowe s character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place her dreams are dangerous to the government represented here by rickman as the intense manipulative interrogator since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer s attention in the end i found the whole thing fascinating not flawless and definitely not for everyone but rewarding it s nowhere near a masterpiece like kieslowski s  a short film about killing  or as explanatory as  dead man walking  but if you re into those films or any of costa gavras political thrillers you may appreciate this one as well just don t expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences	1
1527	this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets it is also very shocking   the physical and psychological torture both explicit and implied is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches so the horror is always unexpected and brutal i m not soft but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer this is the film i will always remember both actors for	1
1528	ms stowe is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who interrogates a children s author because she believes she is trying to plant ideas in her writings that are contrary to the state s this is an incredibly powerful film both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie put this on your must see list if you can locate it	1
1529	rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion what makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real it s almost hard to remember that it s only a movie this is by far madeline stowe and alan rickman s performance of their careers the film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit the only bad thing about this movie is that it s very difficult to get a copy of it i have yet to see it other than on laserdisc this truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on dvd it really is that good	1
1530	what would it be like to be accused of being a subversive this is what this film explores through the eyes of 2 characters one being the accused subversive the other being the interrogator it is a frightening journey from the beginning to the end this film is not for everybody and if you do not understand political governments thoroughly you will never get the point of this film as proved by 90% of the reviews here	1
1531	this movie took me by surprise i first saw it more than 10 years ago and it stays with me still it s got it s just plain boring points and i personally would have ended it differently  this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others the acting is _fantastic_ the cast and director do an amazing job with the script and anyone who likes  different  movies who has the patience to sit and say what the hell is this and allow themselves to be drawn in should give this film a chance if you just want alan rickman to be goofy or to see things explode this is not the movie for you	1
1532	i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter however because of the subject matter it makes the movie all that much more important this is an a movie and i recommend it highly if you liked 1984 book or movie i think you will like this one as well this is harsh to say the least including mental and physical acts of torture some pretty vile not for the week at heart or stomach no gore but her movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn t need blood and guts if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don t think you will enjoy it it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans what they re capable of and the very real possibility that our governmentsdoes not necessarily have our personal best interest in it s heart	1
1533	i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie the acting is astonishing the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth this is an important movie it could be profoundly transformative i would pay good money never ever to see it again because it *is* so good and so complex it is extremely difficult to watch i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once preferably with others so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there s more to the world than the movie	1
1534	even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the finest performances by alan rickman and madelaine stowe without a doubt this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it s citizens for any reason whether they are anarchist s or the writer of children s books will chill you to the bone i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame it still scares the hell out me today it s happening now apparently imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review imdb might want to get a grip some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions	1
1535	this two character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because you re not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure formality did still alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for her multi dimensional performance no doubt about it **1 2	1
1536	closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movie s plot before hand but you don t really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over it in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to people s freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around them if you ve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so	1
1537	this movie gave me recurring nightmares with alan rickman s voice representing an omnipotent insidious fascist ruler the scariest movie i have ever seen   psychological terror more powerful than anything any horror movie has ever achieved alan rickman s voice will always represent to me the power and terror of a totalitarian state reminiscent of orwell s 1984 this movie describes to those who don t care the reality of a large part of current world governments this film is disturbing but in a way that everyone should watch it   it s a description of a reality that no one should ever have to experience but so many do	1
1538	acting of course think about it closet land could easily have turned out so horribly   an entire movie filmed in one room with only two people they better have some damned interesting things to chat about but it didn t turn out horribly on the contrary thanks to incredible portrayals by both stowe and rickman closet land is a masterpiece in its own right that s not to say it is for everyone persons who have had their attention spans decreased through glitzy sex scenes and random gun fire may have trouble digesting closet land however those who can appreciate good story telling without explosions should give it a look no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock	1
1539	this film hits the heart with a reality like no other i have seen it shows what us what we in a democratic society take for granted and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing the acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life mr rickman does wonders with her role as she does with all roles making the interrogator fully dimensional and human the set is incredible it gives the feeling of  in the round theater which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action this movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and i d say they have made a success of that goal	1
1540	closet land was sponsored by amnesty international and does have a lot of political overtones but there s so much more to this richly stirring story than that this is not just about the political tension of the late 80s   it s about the personal persecution that a woman puts herself through as a child who was molested by a family friend we see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest government society structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four young children are molested and one in three women has experienced some form of rape for me it brings up a chilling chicken and egg question does the attitude of our sexual repression leading to predation create the political environment of fear and censoring or does the socio political dysfunction fuel a culture of sexual predation the psychological ramifications of even asking this question force us to a place where we are brought to develop our own answers in the end our young lady writer stowe has a similar moment to the one at the end of hensen s labyrinth   she realizes in one shining brilliant moment that the idea of having her power stolen from her by the secret police rickman is an illusion no one can steal your power   they can only trick you into giving it up and then you have the right to take it back at any time this is not a movie to be entered into lightly and you most certainly do enter it the minimalist aspects coupled with the child like animation stirs the deepest parts of the psyche and leaves no viewer unchanged	1
1541	closet land the title itself conjures up thoughts of secrets and that is really what s at the heart of this amnesty international film government secrets personal secrets both are integral pieces of this story by far the greatest acting seen in too long a time both alan rickman and madeleine stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a government interrogator and victim respectively with only the two actors in this unusual standard length film it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the door a word of caution what isn t mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse while there is no graphic detail about the abuse the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch   especially given the intensity of the film on whole i m not a big fan of amnesty international films but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional and i can t help but make this movie one of my personal favorites	1
1542	rachel and chuck yoman valerie harper gerald mcraney decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family so they packed up their reluctant son gregory togel and daughter tammy lauren and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a mayberry feel later the residence seems to be more like the people in deliverance soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get ax cepted as the antagonists  can the ignored young stevie save her parents or will their pursuers put her her foot in it this film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces they could not have chosen better actors and daryl anderson was exceptionally creepy an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs	1
1543	the premise of the story is common enough average family wants out of the rat race wants to find the simple lifeso they move from sherman oakscalifornia to lake tomahawk kids in tow the lake is beautiful they have leased an old housebut wait there may be something in the lake people are being murdered and no one knows how never mind why gerald mcraney is excellent a familiar face for lifetime viewers valerie harper is also good since this film was made in  88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric and darryl anderson as a bruce dern lookalike crazed military man while the story plot is a bit over the top if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from psycho deliverance as well as other horror stories of that genre several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu sit back and enjoy if you don t take it too seriously it is very entertaining and better than for example the more recent movie i know what you did last summer it seems they made better movies in the good old 80 s	1
1544	this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery   horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake tommahawk i for one would not mind living there all in all a great film to watch over and over again	1
1545	not a film of entertainment but of real lives & limited ambition for the working class in 60 s enjoyable because of my upbringing not sure it d work for most people typical loach full of tv actors actresses of 70 s 80 s 90 s	1
1546	recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchen sink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can t stop loving criminals my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit outisde and gossip about all the men who walk past the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol s first husband but if you can get past that you re ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s	1
1547	one of the best of the  kitchen sinks  fantastic views of london and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60 s loach s eye seems to capture everything yet makes no judgment   a taste of things to come as with  kes   riff raff  and  sweet sixteen  it serves as a cinematic social history of britain carol white is completely convincing you love her fancy her want to take care of her but hold your head at her self destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope well backed up by terence stamp  fresh off  the collector  also catch  the hit   and a plethora of english faces  all looking very young  pefectly set to donovan s dulcet tones stamp sings  yellow is the color  in a lovely scene ending with her saying  getting better ain t i   song also used in  the rules of attraction    i think  watch carol whites screen mum getting ready to  go out and get a bloke  putting on her false eye lashes to the sound of  rosie  on the radio   priceless a treasure for anyone who was around at the time and a reminder of how good life is now in england incidentally soderburgh used clips from  poor cow  in  the limey 	1
1548	ken loach showed the world the down and out flip side of swinging london with poor cow about london woman joy carol white hooking up with a thief and having a son with her only to see the man end up in the slammer while her friend terence stamp manages to help her out some she proves to be little better in what a loser she is it soon becomes clear to joy that she s going to have to make a serious decision about where she s going in her life one thing that i determined   i don t know whether or not this is accurate   was a use of irony in the movie her name is joy but she experiences no joy in her life even if that wasn t intended it s still a movie that i recommend to everyone featuring songs by donovan one of which   colors   appeared in another terence stamp movie the limey which incidentally came out in 1999 when i was as old as my parents were when poor cow came out	1
1549	back in the 60 s this grim study of joy a young proletarian wife was the introduction to the career of ken loach who became one of the most distinguished and respected british filmmakers of all time by then i knew very little about brecht politics or the reality of the under privileged and i was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film its free style its austere color cinematography and joy s monologues in front of the camera i was also much surprised to find that terence stamp who had become a celebrity thanks to billy budd the collector and modesty blaise had so little screen time although 20th century fox distributed poor cow in panama loach did not stay in mainstream cinema which this film hardly is and i lost contact with her films i just heard of her successes kes family life black jack until i caught up in the 80 s the beautiful title song by donovan by the way is available in her anthology troubadour	1
1550	i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film noir in the movie its first 30 minutes or so it s really nice and done in a good old fashioned way with the right camera angles and use of light it doesn t mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry it s definitely a better movie than the average  later  columbo movie entry 26 years after her previous columbo movie appearance george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk again as the murderer in a total different and new role of course i liked her in her role and she was a good columbo  villain  who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition they had some nice sequences together problem with the  modern  new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn t feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk this movie obviously doesn t suffer from this problem but i must say though that this movie doesn t feature peter falk at this best she has certainly played the character better and her performance isn t quite consistent enough within this movie which is probably also due to she movie its director daryl duke who also directed the really dreadful movie tai pan among many other projects it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn t help of course it got used before in the 1975 movie columbo playback nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough  original  moments of its own with its story even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same but oh well that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent if it ain t broke don t fix it it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant which doesn t mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others it doesn t make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective relieving columbo comedy simply a good late columbo movie entry 7 10	1
1551	after being off the air for a while columbo returned with some new made for tv mysteries that while not being as good as the original series are better than the shows that were done in the later  90s murder can be hazardous to your health used the then and i guess now if you think about it true crime shows as the situation for a murder the murder is committed by a very successful egomaniacal true crime show host george hamilton in a nice bit of casting her chain smoking nemesis who lost the job to her played by peter haskell attempts to blackmail hamilton when she discovers a porno video hamilton made with an underage actress in her salad days hamilton uses haskell s cigarettes to deliver the death blow via poison giving herself an alibi as well columbo is brought in to find out what happened you know the rest highly entertaining	1
1552	this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths well written by shane black the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director jack swanstrom clearly swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future her strength lies in her adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom this thought provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action drama suspense and mystery as with all good films the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense you find your self looking for the answers along with marquette audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit   with many awards received they must have agreed that awol 2006 is well worth watching  i d love to own a copy   how do i go about getting one	1
1553	if you re into alternate realities contemplating what s real and what s just a fantasy this is an edge of your seat thriller that ll keep you guessing and really make you think try to get a copy of it and see for yourself i watched it at an la film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw it helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened it s very well directed and the production value is top notch i would compare it to jacob s ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we re in you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it s screening at any festivals near you try to check it out	1
1554	i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting awol however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster s comments with the film i saw awol is quite aptly written by shane black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all awol proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film	1
1555	excellent story wonderful acting amazing production values and a cool action packed short with a perfect twist at the end what a great short film  i saw this film in vail or aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it then i saw it again at another festival where it won again and i was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around   for a short film this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time awol is not for the faint of heart but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film   for any film actually it s an interesting story told very well and every scene moves the story which reveals good film making instincts went into making this film the film looks gorgeous and david morse is also stunning with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene watching her character attempt to defeat the curveballs life is throwing her makes a great viewing experience it also should be noted that when tortures of war are in the headlines everyday the lines between reality good and evil can get very gray while the rhetoric gets loud and attempts to make things black and white awol smartly allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is what is real and what is not which adds to the mystery both times i ve seen it the audience was way more into this movie than the others playing with it which is saying a lot there are a lot of shorts out there right now but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that awol does it sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off her or her rocker or has some personal agenda because this really is a great example of short independent film making i see a lot of short films and i must say if only all the shorts making the festival rounds were this good then the shorts business would have some serious legs	1
1556	i gave this 9 stars out of a possible 10 if it had had just a teensy weensy bit more plot line i would have given it 10 nonetheless it is a highly interesting film judith ivey playing a likable old floozy should have been given the oscar for her performance emily grace portraying alice whom i had never seen before also does an excellent job and has the sexiest body i think i ve ever seen on film in a beat to heck old car alice has lit out from the ne for florida where she has a friend or maybe it s her sister i m not sure and that s my fault not the film s and high hopes of going to college which she and her family can t really afford she seems rather vulnerable out there on the road alone and sure enough she encounters some slightly rough looking characters and shortly after that it s discovered there s a hole in one of her tires she is at a rest stop at the time and is assisted by a woman named sandra and her husband bill an older couple who are traveling in an rv they re going south to florida and take her under their wing but is everyone quite the way they re presenting themselves flashbacks and paranoia enter the story as our young heroine learns some new lessons about life	1
1557	what alice found is the greatest movie that nobody s ever heard of i underestimated it when i heard of it and i though that it would all sex no plot and just really stupid but in reality it was really good they say all indie movies suck but this one and napoleon dynamite didn t suck i asked my friend who d seen it before i did and she said that alice has all these three ways and you see all this nudity but no there is no three way that i remember and little nudity the movie did have a point and it taught me never trust hitchhikers i liked that in the end they got alice a little dolphin in the end on her way to flordia i totally suggest seeing this movie	1
1558	fantastic film wow   this is really a treat i can t believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie  a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv after she has a flat at a rest stop however she learns that things aren t as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy alice emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film i m sure we ll be seeing emily in more films in the future contrary to what some others have said the lighting and photography in this were just perfect the editing was done well too   just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip i didn t see it on the big screen but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it more films like this are *exactly* what we need sf	1
1559	i wasn t expecting a whole lot when i rented this film as a lot of independent films seem to be a bit overrated these days well hollywood films too for that matter but this movie was fantastic really great it s too bad it didn t reach a huge audience because it s just superb i really love alice s determination it really makes me look upon my life as a gift and i see how privileged i am just to have an education but all of that aside this movie really proves that a good artist can tell a good story no matter what the budget it s an excellent film and everyone should watch it they will love it and definitely learn something from it i don t have to be roger ebert to know it s one of the best movies i ve seen all year and certainly one of the most truthful	1
1560	this is most likely the best picture not many will see it presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way a must see for all who like indie and for those who don t i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene the acting was top notch the character of alice was portreyed so well with perfect akwardness this movie ahould be brought to the mainstream i think it would do phenominally alice is the most real look at an element of our culture that i have seen since go ask alice a look that is untouched by the hollywood hand movies like this show young people that these things aren t glamorous but that they are real and compelling if you liked pieces of april you will love this one	1
1561	at the story it is reality mixed with americana  and very original emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job in new england her sleazy boss propositions her  she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register driving from new hampshire to miami florida is not a short trip and her ford escort dies out she then meets a personable older couple portrayed by judith ivey and bill raymond they have an rv and graciously offer to help her out  it isn t safe for a girl to be alone on the road especially i 95 emily grace is very realistic as alice and initially lets the judith ivey character help her buy her decent clothes cosmetics etc at first it is a nice vacation for alice who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend who attends college in miami there is interesting cinematography as the trio drives the rv down to florida the rest stops bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north carolina eventually there is something awry and the ivey character apparently has fabricated stories about her daughter as well as her husband who now seems a bit sinister i will not spoil the outcome of this film  but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense  this film reminded me a bit of spielberg s duel  while it was initially not as menacing  the moral of the story is   you never know what people are thinking  especially if you are driving cross country beware you will enjoy this film	1
1562	judith ivey as the scamming old whore is awesome emily grace the young girl is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down excellent direction and camera story is dark and disturbingsupporting cast is good shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck great independent film small cast pace is slow at first and then moves good a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early for the open road and adventure this movie film has a low budget feel to it but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my tires before i go	1
1563	i just saw this on cable i liked it it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy the cinematography is not so great but the shabby video also adds to the sense of realism so its a trade off you know at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard the accent would sort of come and go anyway i thought the film was well done overall though the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on even though things seemed mundane good job on a low budget another good suny purchase filmmaker way to go	1
1564	a great performance by emily grace i stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider i was high entertained and had much compassion for the character alice played by emily grace the story had me guessing in what would happen to alice and was not predicable the overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters the ending of the story ended on a rather fair way i will purchase this dvd to add to my library i am a new fan of emily grace and i high anticipate in seeing more from her performances	1
1565	at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button surprisingly the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to i scored this movie at 7 but like most would felt it should be a 10 you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects twists and turns etc this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an alabama style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done	1
1566	six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses the one negative review happens to reside or did on the first page of the movie s location in the imdb i found what alice found to be one of the best movies almost no one s heard of that i have seen this year it s 64 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing guess again for me alice was a positively gripping psychological thriller i was virtually on the edge of my seat the entire time it s a very credible story with a realistic script and is very well cast in a fairer world actress judith ivey would win awards for keeping you guessing whether she was good or evil ignore the rating and see this terrific movie and by the way i wish there was a soundtrack album	1
1567	there s nothing much to the story a young woman steals some money from the dreary vermont supermarket where she works decides to run away to florida where she has dreams of attending school with her friend julie and encounters an odd couple on the highway if you remember the elderly couple from rosemary s baby you have some idea of what these two are like bill has a comical face and is retired from the army sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore although we don t find this out at once they re affectionate helpful and full of common sense they more or less adopt the girl alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate rv although they are not driving directly to florida this is where the film could have gone one hundred percent wrong all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil they would take the virginal alice handcuffed to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex alice would have had a heck of a time escaping with lots of aborted attempts before the final shootout but no the couple really is pretty nice and alice is far from virginal alice overhears sandra with a customer asks about the business and tries to turn a trick on her own bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she s going to do it at all they don t talk her into it they guide her alice makes several hundred dollars which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren t going to find it alice misunderstands she doesn t find whoring very pleasant work and she thinks she ll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off sandra responds with what not here honey not in the middle of nowhere however after she is talked into handing her gun over to sandra the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film it had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami julie is after all a legitimate student but when alice calls her friend from someplace in alabama to assure her she s on her way but will be late julie hesitates and says well    my mother doesn t think you should room with us and to tell you the truth my roommate isn t cool on it either i invited you down sure but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something go back to milford alice there is a long silence before alice hangs up only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit tears appear only once nobody slugs anybody else no car explodes in a fireball no cop chases them down the interstate the direction is occasionally clumsy too much cross cutting between sandra trying to disarm alice and alice s hand holding the wobbling pistol there is hardly any musical score there is brief male and female nudity and it s awkward as it s probably supposed to be alice isn t unattractive but she is not babalicious either she sports asiatic eyes a kind of robust version of molly parker the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out the direction is a straightforward narrative with a few illuminating flashbacks nothing is wasted and it was all evidently shot around danbury connecticut the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles i don t know exactly what alice found i dread even thinking that the answer to the riddle is that she found herself the acting isn t bad at all judith ivey is better than that it s definitely worth seeing a quiet orderly film that treats the audience like adults	1
1568	this is a very amazing movie the characters seemed so realistic to me it was hard to believe they weren t real people being from the south i thought judith ivey s character seemed especially real and as everyone else has mentioned she does an outstanding acting job the characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average hollywood stars   their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real  one reviewer mentioned that the main character alice had no good reason to run away from home which is true   she didn t have any moral or upstanding reason to run away such as escaping child abuse etc i thought that she was just fed up with dead end jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in miami the actress shows alice s confusion uncertainty and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness the film also shows how alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options causing her to panic take action and reach out for help  at first the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie but in actuality it is very well done the home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters a part of their rv trip across the country this is definitely a film worth seeing although i don t quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heart warming coming of age tale it is rather vulgar and disturbing at times even if it is not completely sad in the end	1
1569	while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low fi home movie feel i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith ivey charms with character driven delight her performance of sandra is a pleasure    unfolding alternately as diabolical and romantic we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions and never given more information than is necessary her s and the supporting cast s efforts meet bell s post modern fairy tale with arms wide open emily grace s alice is infused with a doey eyed magic she seems to mold like clay before us morphing into some sort of beautiful lost beast by the end we are at odds with words as she is saying goodbye to her mother kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor    whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight    and justin parkinson    whose shy first time john sam provides one of the sweetest if not most awkward sex scenes in film bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it	1
1570	it s a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you ve been seeing in the movie house since day one i had literally no idea how this film was going to end because it went left when i expected it to go right zigged when i expected a zag etc this could have easily unraveled into generic suspense thriller or depressing white trash drama but it stayed a course all its own till the end it is a sad story though not because of what happens to alice but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her down this path the plot has a quiet dignity of form that s usually reserved for theater but the pacing could use some tightening up either way it s a very good film and for some reason i suspect sour grapes from those who have scored this one low	1
1571	having worked professionally with young girls on the run i found this film surprisingly authentic i would never have found it had a friend not loaned her videotape there are classic themes here coming of age mother daughter estrangement the limited choices of the underprivileged who is the good samaritan tragedy is in every life & the many layers or relationships flashbacks are meaningful when alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it and it does not end in clich√© the cast really sells their roles it is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in	1
1572	this is a low budget well acted little gem alice a small town massachusetts teenager fed up with her existence takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market she sets out for florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at miami after her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money she ends up with a retired couple in an rv who also happen to be traveling to florida the couple brilliantly played by judith ivy and bill raymond are overly hospitable and it turns out a prostitute and and her pimp slowly alice is lured into truck stop prostitution as the rv meanders down the thruway in the general direction of florida through intermittent flashbacks we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny milford we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible an excellent well made film that you will think about when it is over	1
1573	writer director dean bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film her dialogue was snappy and her use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film s narrative structure at the heart of the film is the character of alice who is running away from her new england past in a desperate effort to get to florida along the way she travels with a pair of eccentrics bill and sandra who incredibly make the attempt to groom alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops as a newcomer performing in her first screen role emily grace as alice is sensational there is not a false note in her character choices but the film is worth watching above all for the wily yet sensitive character of sandra as masterfully created by judith ivey there is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which ivey is on camera as a viewer i found myself stopping the tape hitting rewind and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to discern the psychological subtleties the film raises the following question about the characters are bill and sandra good samaritans or are they an evil pair of dickensian predators preying upon the youthful alice one of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question alice seems more self confident than she started out as a result of her experiences with bill and sandra but is she really a better person part comedy part road picture and part coming of age drama this carefully crafted film succeeds in involving us on many levels	1
1574	until i did a web search on what alice found i didn t realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of lewis carroll s books the book s complete title is through the looking glass and what alice found there the alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of lewis carroll s alice her fresh and assertive character however is similar the movie alice begins as a young woman in new hampshire who steals money from her ass patting boss and takes off for miami vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins she encounters a middle aged couple in a motor home the husband s retired from the military who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car s breakdown perhaps caused by their mechanizations as it turns out the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet young alice as a promising recruit the wife played by judith ivey in a performance worthy of some big award buys alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup initially alice passively accepts her ministrations and with the couple s instructions does several tricks the encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life the man is shy and deferential and apologizes for finishing too fast what s wonderful about alice and different from her prototypes from clarissa to sister carrie is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself this is how things really are prostitution is everywhere people are neither all good or all bad alice leaves the motor home with her well earned money and a feeling of mutual respect	1
1575	what alice found was a pleasant discovery as written and directed by a dean bell this is combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale as well as a voyage of discovery if you haven t seen the film maybe you should stop reading here alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a new england town her pretext for leaving is going to join her best friend who is away studying at a miami university alice is the product of a single mother s home one that is struggling to make ends meet in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit in flashbacks we get to see alice s life before going on the road alice like her namesake in alice in wonderland embarks in a trip to the unknown that life hasn t prepared her for the highways of america are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse she wants to help her sandra and bill convince her to come along in their plush rv on her way down south nothing has prepared alice for what this couple turns out to be after all in her sheltered life she hasn t dealt with what sandra and bill her new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the american highways it comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind sandra is nothing but a prostitute that plies her trade among the truck driving populace one meets in those places alice brilliantly played by emily grace is a study in how the young woman awakens to the new reality she can t escape in fact sandra makes it seem so easy that alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money judith ivey gives a tremendous performance as sandra ms ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman one wouldn t suspect she is doing the nasty with clients she and bill find along the route they travel ms ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing alice as the husband bill raymond is good in her portrayal as the husband that in reality is a procurer under the excellent direction of mr dean bell the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit	1
1576	just finished this impressively nutty affair and whilst i can t say as it was as good as i had hyped it up to be in my mind it was still an effective and at time pretty nasty piece of brain warped and misogyny fuelled j trash its story tells of a poor gal searching for her sister who winds up getting raped and drugged by yakuza scumbags and the helpful lady doctor who sets out to avenge her doing so in bizarrely gruesome fashion after a similar bout of rape and drugging oh yeah and there s a bit of straightforward sex in there as well sadly its all soft core as per the japanese disapproval of below the belt nudity but pixelation is minimal in fact only really noticeable in a hilarious blow job scene although writer director kazuo gaira komizu fails in creating an especially compelling tale this is at least pretty scuzzy stuff diving early on into the well of filth with a pretty unsettling rape made worse by the fact that the gal looks kinda young though i m pretty sure she was of age also for the most part this is pretty professional looking stuff maybe not stylish but it has a certain flair and the content is handled reasonably well with particular kudos for largely avoiding having to employ much pixellation things are mostly sex rape based for about two thirds of the sharp runtime and its pretty watchable if you groove to such fare it gets a bit numbing after a while but the ladies are easy on the eye and it is reasonably harsh at times the music from y√¥ichi takahashi is occasionally effective though hardly a key part of the show it does in a few spots complement the action neatly at any rate enough for me to notice it more important are the effects by nobuaki koga which pack an impressively splattery punch when they appear helped out by the lunatic nature of the climactic shenanigans things even pull to a curiously affecting ending sure it ain t a weepy or anything but for a film so gutter level for most of its runtime it is relatively poignant altogether this is a pretty entertaining diversion for mean spirited trash fans especially those with a taste for japanese rapey adventures i could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore also perhaps more of a point brains but hey it kept me watching and it is pretty nicely stocked with memorably wtf moments so if you dig this sort of degenerate junk probably worth your while just maybe don t expect the second coming	1
1577	if they gave out awards for the most depraved and messed up movies in the world japanese cinema would clean up their exploitation cinema wipes the floor with most other contenders the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw dropping exercises in bad taste nauseating gore freakish weirdness and misogynistic sex guts of a beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth offering discerning viewers just over an hour of full on debauchery and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane j splatter goodness the film opens with a young woman named yoshimi whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty yakuza who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called angel rain after the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman she manages to escape and flees to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist hiromi megumi ozawa attempts to help however the distraught and confused yoshimi ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof turning into a water melon as she hits the ground at least that what it looked like to me seeking to avenge yoshimi s death hiromi lures higashi a member of the yakuza to her office and whilst jacking her off hypnotises her into attacking her fellow gang members after higashi goes slash happy with a knife in the yakuza hq she is severely beaten and stabbed forced to tell of her meeting with hiromi and then hacked into itty bitty pieces the psychologist is then captured by the gang subjected to a spot of forced buggery whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a yakuza slut and injected with angel rain¬óafter which she promptly carks it the gangsters then plonk her body in the boot of their car along with the remains of higashi ready for disposal before they can ditch the corpses however the super dope has an unexpected effect on hiromi she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothy penis and a ravenous gash and hellbent on revenge sets about killing the yakuza one by one this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter including a messy head squish a man being suffocated by the monster s oozing vagina and a woman being screwed to death by its giant gnashing phallus as you can most likely tell from the above synopsis this is some crazy screwed up stuff and probably not to the taste of most sane people but for those weirdos who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well versed in asian excess guts of a beauty should prove to be delightfully diverting and deviant fun 75 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb	1
1578	kazuo komizu strikes again with entrails of a beautiful woman the sequel to entrails of a virgin this time around the story is based around a psychologist megumi ozawa who decides to take on the yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day when she gets over her head and the yakuza capture her she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery it apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine but she soon melds with another body to be disposed of to become¬Ödum dum dum ¬ñ super slime hermaphrodite zord this she she = it makes mince meat out of the yakuza and saves the day¬Önot really well it is better than entrails of a virgin but not by much most of the film a whopping 67 minutes consists of rape and sex with fogging and the usual ho hum stuff almost towards the end we finally get our gore groove on with a few cool sequence like an alien inspired penis monster through the stomach scene and a gooey asphyxiation but it still suffers from a hyper low budget feel that makes it fun but can t elevate it from z grade soft horror core fare	1
1579	guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin although this film isn t really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all the way around than virginbut then again that s not really saying much beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight faced exploit film a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion as this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa and that they re gonna do the same to her they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide the clinic worker moved by the young lady s story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower level guys and trying to hypnotize her to make her kill the yakuza leaders this whole plan backfires so now ms vigilante clinic worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got   only worse some pretty rough butt rape ensues along with the pre requisite gang rape she too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim       it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon no sht that s what really happens this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty fcking insane kill scenes   including a very classy chest burst rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn and my favorite   a head engulfed by demon vagina kill complete with demon vagina slimethat has to be seen to be believed definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty but still very disjointed feeling beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non compatible way still i have to give the film credit   the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall a solid 7 10 for another crazy j horror classic	1
1580	this movie i would like to say was completely great i can see how many people would think that it s just a shocker film this isn t completely untrue but it s as much of shocker fiction as chuck palahniuk s books are one of my favorite movies of all time bijo no harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to it s scary funny silly gross full of off the top material and to some people arousing the fist time i saw this it was with my friend and her mother had brought it home for her to see it she said it was just some screwed up japanese movie but i saw so much more of it it s badly made yes but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful too as the director says herself this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason its like atrophy if you leave audiences soft then the entire human race is going to be soft i think this is a good philosophy and i agree with it one hundred percent bijo no harawata is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of fitness yogurt and all of this new wave stuff	1
1581	i know that guts of a beauty and guts of a virgin are crap films and are hated by many but i m gonna put myself under the bus here and say i like  em especially guts of a beauty aka entrails of a beautiful woman watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and i was surprised how well it actually went over entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don t find too much of outside of asia specifically japan in this case it s basically a rape revenge flick with a reincarnated monster instead of some silly shotgun murders or a motorboat propelled noose or even a ticked off daddy with a chainsawthat stuff s just silly wouldn t you rather see a hermaphroditic monster with a hilarious little snake monster for a winky perversion factor this movie is high in graphic sometimes wacky rape sequences fake pop shots and satisfying masturbation and monster sex sequences that you oughta like if you like corman nuggets like humanoids from the deep i dunno maybe that s a stretch but i personally didn t think entrails of a beautiful woman let me down as an avid fan of asian sleaze and bizarro b pics yeah i know sometimes some of my recommendations are not always everyone s cuppa tea even for those of you who like the same kind of garbage as i do but i stand behind this one 8 10	1

1583	i recently saw episodes 1 4 and now i can t wait for 5 & 6 to be available i ve heard they are coming soon commander s log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy it s obvious that the budget was small but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident in fact the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more bowlsby is a master of the put down i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co workers let s just say that if you don t like commander s log i ll personally see to it that your undies get extra starch	1
1584	i first heard about commander s log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention craig bowlsby linden banks sophie banks and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although commander s log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting linden banks who plays chief petty officer blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona bowlsby s original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didn t get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a one hour show which space normally showed in two half hour episodes the existing dvd doesn t include episode 3 which premiered at cascadia con in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in 2006 but if you re in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you	1

1586	a kooky but funny bit of diversion you kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what s happening but each report to earth has it s own little joke pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci fi tv show it s fun to watch sort of in the vein of red dwarf but even more low budget for someone who s just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because they ve been moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died also the main guys are from the laundry corps which is why they have laundry in everything if you like red dwarf you ll probably like this slightly different tv concept in that all you see is the commander s report each day it would be better if this were explained more not just in the very beginning of the first episode but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in red dwarf too if you hadn t been told	1
1587	visconti s death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made while watching we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius endlessly opulent death in venice surely is but in other important ways it s an unsatisfying film thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von aschenbach s literary career and output of her imperious manner her layer upon layer of programmed self conscious behavior when tadzio appears and obsession arises it s evident that aschenbach hasn t the slightest idea who she is beneath her gilded age trappings and carefully lived life in fact upon seeing tadzio the  solitary  as mann sometimes calls her splits in two aschenbach no 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14 year old boy then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as she would a work of art   a  divine  work of art but aschenbach no 2 emerges as a stalker who takes control of then replaces the rational aschenbach no 1 like the original aschenbach her sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of her obsession   and thus tadzio remains a far off ideal thomas mann has no mercy for this game every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist that venice is gripped by disease means nothing to aschenbach   except that her game now has higher stakes when she finally whispers beneath her breath  i love you  she knows that all is lost and the abyss awaits is any of this filmable perhaps and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from but there are errors she and dirk bogarde create aschenbach as sympathetic mann again did not aschenbach s pov dominates the film and we are expected to identify but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease   but what s underneath bogard s reactive performance has no mooring mann writes a character who is in her imagination doing the dance of the seven veils all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites yet unable unwilling to resist also visconti s screenplay creates a character not in the original   alfred a friend of aschenbach s   to dramatize mann s discussion of art and artists these scenes are badly written disasters and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch also visconti s aschenbach is a gilded age teutonic composer which i think works for the film and the symphonies of mahler substitute for aschenbach s novels mahler s great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played so death in venice as visconti hands it to us is not the complete success it might have been but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied all students of film especially cinematography will want to take a look	1
1588	luchino visconti has become famous to the world after her marvelous production the leopard movie fans got to know the style of the director who introduced herself as one among the post war new realists an aristocrat who developed her individual free thinking and consequently expressed them as an artist however when applied to this movie morte a venezia based upon the novel by thomas mann it s a slightly different story the entire film is at first view so unique so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of an artist both director and main character gustav von aschenbach that it seems to be unwatchable for many viewers therefore such opinions about the movie rose as being too slow unendurable or endless boredom why the reason seems to lie in a significant view widespread nowadays good movie is parallel to flawless action here it would be appropriate to say good movie is parallel to no action as a matter of fact everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole movie s content and that would suffice all that we find in morte a venezia has a sense of vague reality filled with both profoundity and shallowness that appear to be significant for the sake of each single moment and it is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in venice when we see gustav at the railroad station when we are supplied with her intensely emotional memories the insight into her decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to go on watching the film is to do her her best to feel and experience rather than see and think all is doomed to fade to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes in other words all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs as a result it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of the movie after a single viewing it must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open if you ll like it or notthat s a different story very personal one the artistic values are the factor that is noticeable at first sight and stays with us throughout beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that appears to come and leave rest as something she s heading for so badly and which comes to her in the most unexpected way feeling that she finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all the dreams and desires as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust which vanishes the costume designer piero tosi does a splendid job in this movie through lots of wonderful wardrobe she supplies us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place the cinematographer pasqualino de santis provides us with a terrific visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes and in the background comes gustav mahler s music the composer whose life inspired thomas mann to introduce the character  the performances are top notch particularly from dirk bogart as the main character gustav von aschenbach who wants a rest after hard artistic job and vainly attempts to find it in crowded venice for the majority of the film we have a great insight into her thoughts feelings and acts of anger exhaust and despair though sometimes depressing she keeps us on the right track till the end not losing hope for the less tragic end tadzio bjorn andersen depicts the model of decadent homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and purity that appears to last pretty short adieu tadzio it was all too short says the main character a great though very controversial job is done by mark burns as a sort of super ego alfred with whom gustav polemics about such ideals as beauty justice hope human dignity for alfred beauty belongs to the senses how freudian yet how dangerous the idea might be and ever present in artistic italian movies of the time silvana mangano   here as an elegant lady from poland tadzio s mother memorable moments indeed constitute the movie s strong points yet not all viewers will find them unforgettable they similarly to the whole odd movie require much effort to get onto the right track in director s individual ego and within the four walls of her psyche among such scenes i consider the beach sequence pretty important particularly the way gustav observes tadzio the physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to come closer i also appreciate the shots when gustav is sitting in the gondola and the city s view moves in the background   how memorably that may raise existential thoughts of transfer aren t we people a sort of passangers in the world in the journey that life is in the end i must tell you one important thing i had found morte a venezia extremely weird until i started to look deeper at what the director is really trying to convey then every scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you don t have to agree i hardly agree with anything the main character does but you should at least tolerate this as something the author badly wanted to say listen to her voice allow her for a few words in one page of reality therefore there is a long way towards understanding the film since not many movies like that were being made in 1971 and are being made now paradoxically it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this film in the long run similarly to that we are all bound to experience once a strange unavoidable usually unexpected reality that death is 7 10	1
1589	this is a ravishing yet spare adaption of thomas mann s novelette of the same title dirk bogarde gives her finest screen performance   she herself believed so the dialogue is minimal so her face must register the nuances of her anguished character   a composer a writer in the novelette   the only major alteration who travels to venice in 1910 visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty it s passing and the whiff of decay beneathtrained as an opera director visconti blends mahler s music and imagery seamlessly in her finest film since the leopard another stunning film which greatly influenced coppola s sicily in the godfather	1
1590	relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match mahler s 5th is gorgeous but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film there are many aspects to this film but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty its spontaneous nature absence of logic for love and adoration i am also an ardent fan of bogarde and believe she was rarely as wonderful try her in the servant however note i recommmend multiple viewings	1
1591	 this film is a summary of visconti s obssessions the decadence of nobility death aesthetic search homosexualityall mingled with melancholic mastery slow paced just to make you abler to contemplate all its beauty which is in the music and the images as well as in the storythis is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy anymore brave deeply personal and intelligent the genuine fruit of a genius like visconti	1
1592	morte a venezia is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful it s really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences it s a masterpiece i also recommend the novel luchino visconti is a genius	1
1593	death in venice is a movie i need to see once every ten years it is always different because i am always at a different stage of life the movie is about art beauty longing death some scenes are painfully slow others simply annoying to watch especially if you have seem them before yet i would not want to miss a single frame the music is repetitive the main theme of the adagietto from mahler s fifth is used again and again yet i would not want to miss a single note when the last image fades the last note dies i am left numb and exhausted this movie is a monument to film making as with most really good movies the saturday evening crowd should stay away from it and this is simply the best movie ever	1
1594	caution spoilers although this film moved a bit slow at times the brilliant scenery richness of the characters and powerful themes make `morte a venezia  a rewarding experience i have not read thomas mann s book but i am certain that visconti s visual splendour musical score and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice  the study of gustav von aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions behaviour and passion this tendency is demonstrated in the scene in germany between alfred and gustav when alfred describes music as being both mathematical  ie quantifiable  and emotional this conflict arises again in the scene where young tadzio is alone playing `fuer elise  in lobby of the hotel and gustav recalls her visit to a bordello where she is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song in her flashback after paying the prostitute gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of her actions this reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that tadzio represents ultimately gustav is forced to make her biggest decision stay in venice and resign herself to her lust and temptations or flee venice to save her own life her early attempt to flee venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging her stay complimenting the captivating character interaction visconti s powerful scenery especially of venice at dawn and the final scene of tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon renders this film a true masterpiece	1
1595	if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared death in venice would have to be it it is a monument in movie history much criticized for being slow boring and too obvious in stating it s point an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed first mentally then physically we should appreciate this movie for what it is  morte a venezia  was shot over 30 years ago and it portrays a period even further back at the beginning of the twentieth century life was slow then compared to now people were supposed to behave in a certain way hiding their true emotions even from themselves director visconti and dirk bogarde the leading actor admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von aschenbach discovers her romantic interest in a young boy for a man like von aschenbach in her time this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with we see her inner struggle mostly on the face of bogarde against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by gustav mahler this movie is slow there is no denying it no special effects car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats no perverted sex scenes either the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile so basically nothing much happens in this movie not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto this is the movie to do it	1
1596	the greatest tragedy man faces is that capable so often of the divine she settles for the banalfrom this fact does so much great tragedy emerge death in venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head onit confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms self denial and decay undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema its austerely refined look echoey sound mixture of unsubtitled languages and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director the central performance at once rigid aroused and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights bogarde as if not the best british actor of her generation then certainly the most adventurous able to hold on to sympathy as her desires take her over and interesting despite the endless close ups and mahler score playing above her not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation	1
1597	a film to divide its viewers just criticism points at its funereal pace over used snap zooms and persistent lingering gazes between the protagonists advocates point to dirk bogarde s mighty performance and pasqualino de santis  benchmark photography of venice taken altogether this might suggest an indulgent romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love at a time 1971 when it was becoming consensually legal in fact visconti has succeeded in making a richer more complex film than such a single issue vehicle she has knit her ideas   foibles and all   into a meticulously paced arc inside this does indeed sit the central performance of bogarde s aschenbach rather than a simpering johnny come lately gay she manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in tadzio her mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist s tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback mahler s music is possibly a little over used although it is well appropriated the italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn t suffer too much 7 10	1
1598	his music especially what we hear of it here is very slow from around the time of bach s death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace over a century later wagner and then mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get  of course one can cheat by writing a 4 4 march and then specifying a tempo of say semiquaver = 1 but that tempo wouldn t be the correct tempo wagner and mahler wrote music that is properly played at a snail s pace given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow snail s pace is the wrong expression a critic wrote of a famous wagner conductor she doesn t beat time she beats eternity for all i know this was meant as a compliment i get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films there s death in venice and there s solyaris i much prefer the former for one thing solyaris steps over the line or some line and becomes soporific death in venice is gripping from beginning to end not much happens but it all happens in the right sequence at the right pace with photography you can get lost in another way of cheating with music by the way is to write something that doesn t really have a tempo at all such music sounds slow but is really just unmusical just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form death in venice isn t one of them beautiful in every respect it will remind you of the timelessness and contextlessness of quality you need no theoretical knowledge to respond to visconti s mastery as you do to respond to a lesser director s incompetence it s a great work	1
1599	i m not sure where to start with this in short it was a disappointing movie having taught the novella i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and aschenbach but it doesn t represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella  for one i was expecting an older aschenbach and a younger tadzio in the book tadzio is fourteen but she is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie she reeks of sexuality and is a tease she is an accomplice to aschenbach she always looks back at her almost provokingly in the book it is aschenbach who steals glances at the boy as for aschenbach i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann s brother heinrich than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair in all fairness i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job but either someone else should have done that or she should have made to look older at the beginning  i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on aschenbach s obsession of tadzio and does not justify it i liked the fact that mahler s music was used because ultimately she did inspire mann to write her story i m not sure turning aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move or the creation of alfred who i don t remember in the book and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors  lips i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i m thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesn t correspond to their faces i m thinking of the scenes when aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing this scene could should have been the strongest but it was annoying instead	1
1600	 philistines beware especially american ones this has all the elements you ll hate   a langorous approach to film language a painterly sense of composition an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative a wonderful and unusual use of music and even worse it s based on a story you d probably hate as well if however you do feel that films don t to have derivative plotlines be full of action and crappy dialogue don t need the visual grammar of mtv tv commercials then watch this it s one of my favourite films and is perhaps visconti s most perfectly formed piece of work it s sublime like the movement of mahler she uses insistently throughout the film	1
1601	i saw this film many years ago and absolutely hated it    i could not wait for it to end and would have walked out but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder you know what i have never forgotten this film and more i would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years how many movies have i wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse then forgotten as soon as i hit the street like  you see i can t even think of one rarer are films like death in venice that enter your consciousness and work sea changes the french like to say film is an art and movies like this one prove they are right i give it 10 stars up from the 3 i gave it the night i saw it	1
1602	visconti s masterpiece i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of her work but i cannot imagine her other work surpassing this fabulous film last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw this captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements the extraordinary shots directed by visconte primarily her love of long languorous shots of people dining swimming walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of visconti s shot selection the acting by the principles without over riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone it is true young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film a film that could not be made in 2006 a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money men took secondary roles as many of the recent imdb commentator s have written this film in their judgment is long boring too little action and pretentious i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap these comments contain merit unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years please if you have not seen death in venice rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time you will be rewarded	1
1603	personally i can only but agree with stephen 12 indulge there s really no point in trying to  capture  this film i like movies where nothing explicitly happens herzog s  aguirre der zorn gottes  has got the same nothingness though that movie is less convincing since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story so herzog had to focus on nature versus kinski morte a venezia is wholly different though since it has several climaxes turns etc in fact from the point where aschenbach s luggage is lost the movie almost  rushes  to its grand finale her final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where she fantasises about warning the polish family and caressing tadzio s hair you can if you want to seek some real clues symbols in this one her trying to leave behind her luggage from the moment she arrives the pointing tadzio at the end the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in sinc but there s no point in doing this it won t make the film better or worse since its force lies in the whole storyline s undertow which is never made explicit tons of history decaying europe the end of the  romantic era  as we ve come to know it which has proven to be only the beginning of it individual emotions & expression are more important now than they ever were but wait now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor tiny flaw of the film the  let s talk about art  parts now there s one thing never to do i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means furthermore i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film i don t like explicit films i can read books so i don t want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale i prefer films that you cannot explain in words but only in film lynch s lost highway weir s picknick at hanging rock and roeg s man who fell to earth also belong in this category for then and then only it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book so what about thomas mann s novella i ve never read it but forget about it the movie gives a different point of view it says things you can never say in a book it uses the movie art to make you feel through images and music the same thing that mann made you feel using text equally brilliant but different worlds	1
1604	contains spoilers luchino visconti s film adaptation of thomas mann s novella is visually if not philosophically faithful to its source britten s opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made  in the visconti version the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring more decadent and effete if you ve read the novella it s like having the descriptions on its pages come to life dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von aschenbach although she has very little dialogue she conveys the bitterness aroused passion and finally pitiful yearning of aschenbach through facial expressions alone bjorn andresen the young actor who plays tadzio the beautiful object of aschenbach s desire was perfectly cast she too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures the tadzio character is pivotal to the story so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire visconti with her incredible eye for beauty knew exactly what she was doing and changing ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on gustav mahler and then using mahler s music especially the adagietto from the 5th symphony was another brilliant stroke although i d read the mann story before the film mahler s music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film especially that last one of ashenbach dying on the beach as tadzio walks slowly into the sea  one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us	1
1605	from the first to the last scene of the movie director visconti excels at her art to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long it is perfection   as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomings thomas mann s novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when she allows herself to deviate slightly that the transition falters and no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories the almost unbearably heightened serving of mahler s music   still the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me maybe i m just a victim of man s desire to flaw the flawless nevertheless i will offer one example which i regard as crucial warning spoilers in mann s story aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill her after giving up her frustrated chase of the boy tadzio in venice unable to catch one delight she settles for another   which poisons her it is very subtle in the book but it is there the forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of her surrendering life itself in visconti s film she also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach the chase in venice ends in a much more melodramatic way it works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multi layered symbolism giving food for thought but that s all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest   the last gesture of tadzio standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale	1
1606	it may be hard to explain how but this film is a masterpiece perhaps because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry the true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession bogard is amazing and needless to say that venice is utilised as a perfect scenery dark sinking and dreary just like bogard s soul and classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings in my opinion a classic masterpiece of european film making	1
1607	i can t quite explain why i find this so alluring and the leopard not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that visconti can render so magnificently like that film it has a majestically slow pace but this time it isn t overlong it s the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini story like the leopard it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos    though bogard s performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look she has a really stupid grin that s easy to dislike it s often quite beautiful in the quiet moments it s the opulence of visconti s films the grandeur of the ball scenes that i find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision but here that is part of the point    gustav surrounded by a visual din the way in which the object of gustav s affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant    the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful feminine featured boy it s like an allusion to shakespeare s sonnets and it doesn t feel heavy handed it s not until the camera views tadzio fully pulls back and we see her long slender legs that we realize she is not a boy but an adolescent    at first we re forced to question gustav s attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that and she doesn t shy away from it visconti is extremely patient with gustav we get a sense of the man we know her it s a largely silent performance and when she does open her mouth it s to spew venom no wonder she wants the angelic open featured boy to project herself onto there s a difference with tadzio we never know her just as we never know a handful of fellini grotesques but that s because her life is another its own film but it s not as flirtatious as it s been made to seem there is one scene however where she twirls around a pole that s too much tadzio isn t necessarily leading her on    she s looking at her visconti just zooms in is all the film doesn t detail gustav as being gay    tadzio isn t even really male she s a prettified version of a boy delicate pale wispy with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who she wrestles with the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to gustav s homosexuality is the famous barber scene which unlocks her repressed vanity it isn t totally successful    the whole section with alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying bags in long shot could have been excised some parts are heavy handed such as when gustav s boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass her by    the looks on her face are too obvious but during the same scene gustav throws a fit wanting a new rower something so unexplainable that it makes up for it but there are some scenes    touching for the first time    that build up a remarkable quiet intensity tadzio repeating a piano song again and again the notes quivering in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has there is one discussion that contains a debate i m especially interested can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or does it have to go beyond them we can consider tarkovsky who esteems both visconti and mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations i think this one manages to do both 9 10	1
1608	in luchino visconti s film death in venice it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays but in the pursuit of beauty itself gustav von aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man to understand the decay we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us it is best described and explained in a quote from socrates found in thomas mann s version of death in venice beauty alone is lovely and visible at once¬Ö it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses¬Ö else what¬Öif the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not perish and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy tadzio even though the levelheaded part of her mind tells her that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon she cannot contain herself  it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the extravagance of the parlor and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn of the century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer pasqualino de santis but visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of venice instead the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty and these things are relegated to the past the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff the streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot the city decays in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man the death of her daughter and presumably her wife along with the failure of her music allow us to understand why she is destroying herself  alfred with whom aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend she is aschenbach s alter ego and what alfred says articulates the composer s own doubts and fears the scene in which aschenbach decides to leave venice is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling her that she is weak alienated and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a decay of memory rather than objective renderings of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are decayed memories because even aschenbach alludes to it she declares reality distracts and degrades us and following the scene in the travel agent s office we see aschenbach confront tadzio and her family and warn them   leave venice but directly after the encounter we see her sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in her imagination she employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of gustav mahler she allows the viewer s mind to wander as we watch aschenbach s life and respectability decay with the beauty around her  slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth the crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man s attraction to tadzio it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy kindles a fire in her that at first makes her glow then consumes her the film concludes with von aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching tadzio fight with her friend we see the black dye from her hair running down on her cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of her life s expiring moments though before her last breath the final decay has happened all around her the city is soiled and with it she has become what she detests as aschenbach dies she has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed her it was the pursuit of beauty that initiated her decay in the pursuit of artistic beauty she could not sense her own demise and that of the city around her her sensuality is indulged in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in venice together beauty death and decay these themes are visconti s art the beauty of her work is in the decay of beauty itself  in this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man we see the honored composer gustav von aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around her and leads her to a miserable lonely death watching the target of her affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last decay is intrinsic in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the splendor in death in venice it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in visconti s works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define her art	1
1609	story of a strange love and a fall desire poem about beauty and her perfection fear and toucha slice of visconti mahler and mann and an agonize venice idon t know if it is a masterpiece a poem or the reflection of a film director s world it is absolutely a memento mori and a exploration of illusion a old mirror of limits signs and death s delicacy a trip in an old space nostalgic cruel and splendid death is a orfeu s trip copy in the immediate reality and the essence is the music a soft sweet music like honey or winter s fire like every regret and every sorrow like a refuge in deep solitude gustav is gay by accident she is the researcher of last form of god s presence the beauty that beauty who gives life s sense who is sin and virtue in same time the gift of expectations and sufferings she dies because she has right to hope to believe in the reality of miracle and in her way a victim no way only tadzio may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition	1
1610	set in venice mainly on the lido visconti s death in venice is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of dirk bogarde s characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods for those who love venice this is a film to cherish mahler s music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama the mood it creates is not always happy but then what else would you expect with a title like that there is not a lot of dialogue in the film rather sparse in fact it s mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests the intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between gustav von aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room on the beach and at odd unexpected places around venice they seem to acknowledge each other s presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze each viewer will have her own interpretation the composer has lost a child of her own is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child she loved is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with her dazed somewhat girlish stare could she be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece who knows from beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th century venice the elegance of the ladies the deck chairs on the sand the children frolicking in their neck to knee bathing costumes the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world while some may think the pace is rather slow at times the film has an overall gentle quality but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending	1
1611	are sea side resorts the sad dreary places they re always depicted as in movies and novels certainly this movie along with the near contemporary don t look now depicts venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap for a more light hearted approach see just married with ashton kutcher and brittany murphy having never been to venice i can t say for sure but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from luchino visconti one of the great stylists of world cinema having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann novella it s based on which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin britten since i don t know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition i m left wondering about aschenbach dirk bogarde s obsession with young tadzio is she a homosexual a pedophile or is her longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent perhaps tadzio reminds her of what she could have been and now knows she never will be those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung fu at 2 hours and 15 minutes it s not particularly long and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace the film benefits from the ravishing music of gustave mahler on whom aschenbach s character is clearly based dirk bogarde gives a moving performance and the movie is graced by the presence of silvana mangano one of italy s great beauties as tadzio s mother	1
1612	thomas mann s controversial novel is the basis for the film a death in venice  although in the book the hero is an author in the film the director luchino visconti who also wrote the screenplay transforms her into a composer as such the author composer gustav von aschebach dirk bogarde on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned out artisan after a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life she decides to go on vacation to venice where she hopes to rejuvenate her dwindling ambition however while staying at the picturesque seaside resort she captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy tadzio bj√∂rn andr√©sen who eyes her with curious interest and is immediately smitten by her although gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth she nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy s governess nora ricci while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city the movie dialog like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist in the end the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy their affair is never given wing substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book the film allows only the possibility of  what if  nevertheless one can sympathize with the hero and wish her a moment s peace to obtain that which is forbidden elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes great story and a bogarde classic ****	1
1613	cinema s greatest period started in post war europe with italy s neo realist movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed france s new wavers caught everyone s attention and there was always bergman up there on her desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 luchino visconti brought the art form to full circle geographically speaking with her miraculous work *death in venice* which might as well be called *the death of europoean cinema* after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese & co this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing up not just of visconti s particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner task master than the visconti revealed here she s not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind her and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm und drang cosmos we will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the century s great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahler s 5th symphony taking full advantage of mahler s ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into a decrepit composer from her original persona as a writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair duck like walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies it s a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance    a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse cinema just doesn t get better than this i ll ignore the complaints from the ritalin addicts out there who say that it s too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of her is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie s thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what it s mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic herself visconti knew whereof she spoke spoiler    i guess if for nothing else see *death in venice* for its portentous opening credits    and for its unforgettable ending with bogarde s jet black hair dye dripping off of her sweaty dying head and onto her chalk white face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogarde s dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty *death in venice* is a miraculous work of art  dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece *the damned* i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie it s ostensibly in english but the dvd s sound seems muddy and there s a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway  	1
1614	i first saw death in venice 1971 about 15 years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it watching it again few days ago i realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema with hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the mahler s music without which the movie simply could not exist death in venice is a stunning luchino visconti s adaptation of the thomas mann novella about a famous composer in the novella she was a writer but making her a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably gustav von aschenbach loosely based on gustav mahler who travels to venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures her search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when she sees a boy of incredible divine beauty ashenbach dirk bogard follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach her the boy tadzio belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you enchants you conquers you and makes you its prisoner ashenbach became one of the prisoners of tadzio spellbinding charms she became addicted to her she fell in love with her was it bless or curse for her i think both she died from unreachable impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself the last image ashenbach s eyes captured was that of the boy s silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about if she could ashenbach probably would ve said i was able to witness one of the faces of perfection i could not bear it but i was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and i can die in peace now because it did happen to me  unforgettable music gustav mahler s haunting adagietto of her fifth symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie it reflects every emotion of a main character   it sobs it longs it begs for hope and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die i may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to death in venice i dare say that mahler s music is its main character   it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen it sounded triumphantly when ashenbach returned back to venice to what she thought would be her happiness but turned to be her death it sounded gloomy when she first entered venice from the sea you can hear so many different feelings in it   tenderness and adoration confusion and self loathing worship and melancholy but always   love that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts literally the movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer writer artist we are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as achenbach was by the boy s mysterious charm	1
1615	brett piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film experts it is low budget but fun and the leading lady is very sexy i wish i could see more of irene joseph good viewing fun i bought the dvd and enjoyed it the special effects are stop motion animation and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today i always enjoy brett piper movies and if you liked this i recommend bite me screaming dead and anything else she has done i look forward to seeing more of her work and well as more of ms joseph i simply cannot see why this woman hasn t been in more movies as her acting is excellent	1
1616	i bought this dvd from walmart for cheap thinking it would be a typical crap straight to video monster junk but it turned out much better than expected there isn t really any criticism to say about it it s obviously low budget but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun it s very cool and entertaining there s everything horror sex a great plane crash and good characters and i d say it s pretty original cuz it really doesn t come off as any other movie i ve seen it has it s own unique look which i liked very much that s why this film deserves credit i look forward to seeing more of these awesome movies from the scare master brett piper whom i ve never heard before this one the dvd menu is really creative with groovy music playing over it so it s perfect just to keep it on when you re not yet ready to sit down and watch it it also includes some special features which are really interesting but we never get to see the director or hear her in the commentary must be shy this comes out of edgewood studios in vermont usa i highly recommend it to all horror buffs you ll love it	1
1617	in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously the movie is called arachina it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget so what does one expect hitchcock i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the movie the oscar comes to mind most of sylvester stallone s movies the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot the actor who played the old man was actually very good the man who played anal retentive professor was no clifton webb but she did a god job and the bimbo s for lack of a better were played by two competent actors i laughed at the 50 cent special effects but that was part of the charm of the movie it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the 50 s a meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants lobsters rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals a meteor was the cause of the problems this time i was was very entertained i didn t expect much and i go a lot more then i bargained for	1
1618	ok i am a sucker i loved it i had no expectations and had them all fulfilled it was a terrible movie i loved it i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use no one can understand my obsession i can t either to tell the truth for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me now the movie is terrible the special effects are terrible the acting is terrible but i loved it the actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerous  like being able to see through the monsters the arachnids looked like they were made out of plastic garbage bags maybe they were there was light underground tnt wasn t deafening etc you must really love b movies to get any enjoyment out of thisalcohol helps enormously for others	1
1619	this is a low budget stop motion monster movie from brett a nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell piper and it delivers just what i d expect from such a production light hearted though cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters that s why i ve given the film 10 out of 10   because it delivers what i expected it to deliver and a bit more brett doesn t penny pinch when it comes to putting her critters on screen she hurls lots of bugs at her cast for the finale and anyway i love stop motion monsters which compared to cgi critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch	1
1620	as is the case with many films of this ilk my non catholicism got in the way of my understanding it the church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries we have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value then throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them and you have this book and movie i found myself thinking that s pretty cool why did they do that there s this casual thing in the robert langdon character where no matter what the issue she seems to always make the right first move i suppose it s like watching csi where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days they know the lay of the land in this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on but if you create robert langdon you need to set her to work that s ok because heroic nerds like her have been saving the day forever i thought the film was fun i thought the da vinci code was fun too interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think this is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second	1
1621	i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie there s a lot of famous rome monuments and historical locationsit is from the same writer and director from the da vinci code tom hanks stars along with ewan mcgregor and ayelet zurer the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church s most hated enemy the illuminati the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything its a race all of rome following the illuminati trail to get to the illuminati secret meeting place while racing against time to find the path of the illuminati over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it it is a lot better than the movie 2010 and the ending has one awesome plot twist	1
1622	first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da vinci code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn t try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done  second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didn t follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da vinci if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so don t worry about that finally i m glad they removed some silly sub plots and didn t even try to hint at the possibility of langdon and vittoria getting together  the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary that s okay for a film like this  i d give it a 9 10 mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment	1
1623	so first things first angels and demons is a much better and very different film than the da  vinci code following the recent slew of comic book movies remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques lens flare excessive gci and over the top action sequences in this respect angels and demons almost feels old fashionedit offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion vs science offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of god in rome beautifully shot by the way and the temple of modern science that is cern s large hadron collider facility hanks is hanks pretending to be the smart guy and she fits the role much better second time around than her wooden performance in da vinci good support is offered by a rock solid cast with a particular highlight being armin mueller stahl s stoic cardinal but the films main saving grace is it s pace for the entire running time i was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic my only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity but that is not the fault of the film makers rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story speaking of which the story is a cracker mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way overall i would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe and fans of ripping adventure tales in general	1
1624	as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons hanks and company are back for the sequel prequel angels and demons and they have learned their lesson acting wise everyone is much better aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra and better than the girl who played sophie neveau tom hanks is very good as always she is better in this though because she works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors she might even deserve a nomination come march but doubtful she had me convinced right until the very end she s dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobs technically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is muchmuch better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of rome pacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i cannot say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mix my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole antimatter thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in 2003 overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da vinci code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one	1
1625	as a fan of the book this work is fantastically adapted remaining true to the source materials and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work the intrigues translate well to film by virtue of ron howard s good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity i like hanks as robert langdon her portrayal is genuine and earthy with only the barest glint of the kip we all knew and loved back in the day she is a good dramatic actor and while i miss her comedic efforts i do enjoy her more serious performances the subject matter is no less controversial than the davinci code and the vatican seems to never learn their lesson as with the aforementioned film the holy see issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global catholic boycott of the film which of course generated millions in ticket sales although the story of the god particle was played down dramatically and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction the fiction that was left was entertaining and extremely well done and the truth be known people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story as the screen version carries the main story well on its own in fact it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise in order to enjoy this second which should have been a prequel in all honesty although that does not lessen the effectiveness nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work all in all this is good for a friday saturday night s viewing although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones it rates an 88 10 from the fiend 	1
1626	still haven t read a single dan brown book but i watched all her movies adaptations i won t fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn t really the same actually this one is a thriller a race against time filled with puzzles the plot is very twisted imaginative and the cast is excellent i never been a great fan of hanks but she delivers well i noticed her jeans shirt the one spilled with blood because i search for one like this in vain the italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really applauded ewan macgregor portrayal her inner faith and calm is really impressive i really like the debate between science and religion the action taking place in the vatican it felt like vacation at last i am not sure it helps to add new converts into christianism with all the gold and man presence displayed any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers	1
1627	was excited at the opening to hear part of chevaliers de sangreal but wanted more so i bought said hans zimmer piece possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written this movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w o the religious considerations you get to tour the vatican and parts of rome with excellent cinematography the opening at cern where the god particle or largest quantity of antimatter is created with stunning visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie who doesn t love hanks the storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax this film suggests a satisfying compromise between science and religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides science without religion is lame religion without science is blind aeinstein	1
1628	this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown i can t say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing sound effects and sound tracks were very good acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak for people who didn t read the book things may look happening too quickly from my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and using the time not in a good way these are main problems of the movie so it is worth watching but could have been done better	1
1629	symbologist robert langdon hanks is called to rome to help decipher the mystery behind the illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city the da vinci code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of dan brown followers it did not do her award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours seemed to bore many having read the book i was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed tom hanks and audrey tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the louvre but for angels and demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return having asked around most people seem to prefer angels and demons to the da vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans whilst still not fully justified prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release this howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike da vinci tom hanks  robert langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten illuminati in the vatican and because of the time limitations the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats the da vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences the interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders earth wind water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation this really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over just like 3 years ago there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances it is fair to say dan brown is a complex writer she certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst her action and thrilling sequences as well as trying to discover the illuminati there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present all interesting to discover and listen to if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel this was always likely ron howard who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in da vinci returns in perhaps the worst way possible her jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style she is certainly no paul greengrass and this is by no means bourne slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than da vinci	1
1630	i was at the premier of the movie last night in rome i am not an expert in the book however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie the pacing of this movie is much faster than the davinci code many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace i think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for hanks brown and company there are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form i am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way how leonardo vetra was found is also different those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story some minor details are are also cut from the movie although they did film in rome they had to recreate interior shots since i went on a walking tour of rome the day before the movie i can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about cern hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the vatican archives of course they had no access to that area and i am not sure if anyone actually knows what the vatican archives look like eyelet zurer has her break in this movie as victoria vetra and does a good job as eye candy for hanks this movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know ron howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw her and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie	1
1631	i go to the movies to be entertained i was very entertained by the first film in this series the davinci code it had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested angels and demons is no different if you enjoyed the davinci code then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well angels and demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film but faster paced which i liked ron howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit what i really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable if there is one thing that i didn t like about this movie it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable don t want to give any spoilers but hey it s a movie i was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what i saw	1
1632	i read angels and demons about 3 years ago and i can honestly say to is one of the few books that i couldn t put down while reading the movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline tom hanks plays in my opinion a much better role of professor langdon than in the da vinci code you won t have to worry about this being as bad as the da vinci code this is everything that it wasn t much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy if you haven t read the book no worries you will still find it very interesting and if you have read the book well lets say you might be a little let down because i found many scenes missing that i was looking forward to overall pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer but maybe not something too special for dan brown fans	1
1633	where da vinci code introduced us to dr robert langdon and her knack for solving puzzles angels and demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit with a cast of award winning actors ron howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept the da vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return i didn t feel this was with angels and demons the plot was straight forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout cardinal strauss armin mueller stahl was easily my favorite character in the movie her portrayal of the elitist yet misunderstood rank of the catholic church was very good and combined with the victim of her treatment camerlengo patrick mckenna ewan mcgregor you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction there isn t a great amount of tom hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that i had more than enough introduction from the first movie unfortunately i found ayelet zurer s character vittoria vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought she does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being langdon s familiar more so than a necessary partner the plot is as such one of the organizations that the catholic church wronged in the past there have been quite a few has sought revenge in a most artistic manner some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen dr robert landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful vittoria vetra a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church s enemy music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful i could chime on about this menial things but what makes angels and demons absolutely work is it s conclusion it was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings i have seen in a movie and i was impressed at how off guard i was when it hit me like anyone else i appreciate a great wrap up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it needless to say i left the theater pleased at the movie in it s entirety if you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your catholic principles i can say that where the davinci code painted catholicism as a shady cover up group of sadists angels and demons paints them with a much lighter brush the church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks	1
1634	before seeing the sneak preview today of angels & demons i cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards dan brown the fact that it was written by dan brown and because dan brown s name is slapped on all of the posters i went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what i got was a 2 and a half hour roman cat and mouse game with forrest gump and that is by all means good entertainment value the movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself harvard symbologist robert langdon hanks jets off to rome after the pope s sudden death and the re election through papal conclave arranging all of this is the carmelengo patrick mckenna mcgregor however she soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti matter time bomb that vatican city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals langdon using her intellects and trust me you ll be hearing a lot from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious path of illumination aiding her on the quest is cern scientist vittoria vetra zurer who is also the co creator of the anti matter  the movie itself runs at an uneven pace one minute langdon and the swiss guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute she bores you with pointless information about every random object she passes evidently slowing the book s much anticipated action thriller sequences down it makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way  the character s are decently written onto the big screen ewan mcgregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable patrick mckenna famous accent included tom hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since her last performance in the mediocre da vinci code stellen skarsgard plays commander richter the straight faced leader of the swiss guard unfortunately neither her nor ayelet zurer s performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets  however angels & demons accomplishes what dvc could never a thrilling fast paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of st peter s square and basilica including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour ron howard does a decent job at directing this second langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost  while newcomers might call it a national treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense thriller eye candy and brilliant still shots of rome to breathe in fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates a&d does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder  a good book to movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain 74 10	1
1635	tom hanks returns as dan brown s symbologist robert langdon in her first adventure angels & demons which hollywood decided to make after the da vinci code given the latter s more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself the catholic church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly nonchalant about this one and it s not hard to see why considering ron howard had opted to do a flat out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of rome and vatican city and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on location scenes save for st peter s square and basilica which was a scaled model used so i guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down ayelet zurer tried to step into the female void left by audrey tautou but given tautou s character then having a lot more stake in the film zurer s scientist vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti matter in the book she s the fodder of course for langdon to converse her vast knowledge of the vatican the illuminati and the great feud between the two but here she s neither love interest nor her intellectual equal ewan mcgregor on the other hand chews up each scene she s in as camerlengo patrick mckenna who is temporarily taking care of the papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the sistine chapel to elect a new pope and she plays patrick with that glint in the eye with nuances enough to let you know there s more than meets the eye there s no surprises here for readers of the novel but mcgregor s performance here is one of the highlights of the film as hanks plays well tom hanks the book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that dan brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work while reading the book some years ago i thought that should a film be made of it it s easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces sadly that s what this ron howard film did with a pace that doesn t allow a temporary breather unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly it s like reading the book all over again page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action catholic reviewers have called angels & demons harmless because i guess it didn t dwell on its many controversies unlike the da vinci code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith and if anything this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath st peter s basilica and the vatican archives remain out of bounds but the walk along the path of illumination now that s almost free nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who haven t this film may just compel you to pick up dan brown s novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks and characters such as galileo michelangelo and bernini who are intricately linked to the plot but much left unsaid satisfying pop corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular	1
1636	yeah i know my title sucks i couldn t think of any other title x ice is a brilliant first season episode very interesting idea and good acting as well the whole worm looking thing was really creepy in my opinion i ve never been a fan of insects so all the insect episodes are creepy to me x anyway lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode the good the parasite thing awesome scully finally trusting mulder awww <33 it was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear though if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear i think the whole cabin would be dead the bad how did the dog stay alive for so long how didn t huffman get those black spots or maybe she did but no one saw it conclusion very good episode especially for season 1 8 10	1
1637	this definitely the most tension filled x files episode of the first season this episode is what i think of when i hear x files the plot is simple but exiting our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which it s research team appears to have killed each other it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice had infected the research team the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity soon none can tell who they can trust or who s infected or not this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film the thing the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it s occupant have been killed or killed themselves an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out it has the abilities to imitate any life form therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes believe me the thing is one of the most exiting and tension filled horror movies you ll ever see if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice ice is the best direct tribute homage to john carpenter s the thing i have ever seen and it lives up to it s inspiration as one of the best x files episodes i give it a 10 10	1
1638	this is one of the best episodes from the entire x files series creepy beyond words the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as home humbug bad blood and milagro for being the best in their respective season mulder and scully s growing relationship is put to the test in this episode can they really trust each other this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling mulder bring your mittens	1
1639	okay that was just brilliant i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong it really needed more episodes like this  the cast worked perfectly even though they were all nobodies back in the day writing was fantastic and so was the editing great job in all accounts  the episode was thrilling suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end which is what most motw episodes had tried but failed until now  the first five star episode for me really good almost like a movie i didn t even remember it being this good i think it s even better than the great horror movie called  the thing 	1
1640	fbi agents mulder and scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an arctic drilling team in this early  x files  episode that david duchovny herself considers one of their first rockin  episodes it pays loving homage to the much lauded john carpenter 1982 theatrical feature the thing and one can see the similarities visually color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality production design   art direction are especially impressive the shots of the exterior of the arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers naturally our heroes are threatened by the weather so the sound design involving wind evokes memories of the thing the culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team once inside a host it stimulates aggressive behavior this allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold and the way the script is set up we can t be too sure of who s infected and who s not this gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing this episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups it even allows mulder and scully to have moments where they re not sure if they can trust each other guest starring are a good small group of actors xander berkeley felicity huffman and steve hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany mulder and scully on the mission and jeff kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp you can also see one time jason voorhees portrayer ken kirzinger as one of the ill fated original team members incidentally there s one direct link between  ice  and the thing art director graeme murray who worked on both projects 8 10	1
1641	this was truly a tense and dark episode excellently executed wonderful acting and atmospheric directing  ice  is one of my favorite episodes along with  pusher   grotesque   wetwired  and  home  these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case it seem quite realistic to me their paranoia their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors however  ice  had a problem that i got over after a few watches it was too short i wanted more overall  ice  had what 98% of all x files episodes have excellent acting intense story writing gritty directing all the works 10 out of 10	1
1642	ice the limerick a virus pulled out of the ice just didn t know how to play nice if infected you ll kill because you are ill the cure is to be infected twice ice is a great episode one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn t ask for much better throughout the entire series it starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also a group of scientists in alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other now mulder and scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened as mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core a little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who done it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor hodge who is un trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing she asks to see everyone s credentials to make sure we are who we say we are events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to smack in the face from this episode as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly i like bear from the moment i first meet her its a shame she has to die i also like the scene shown from the other scientist s point of view as mulder and scully argue in the other room it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldn t assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets as much as hodges frustrates me in this episode i do think that mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any i really like scully in this episode first of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of mulder keep her from biasing her judgment i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says bosom buddies this is such great writing a way to say without any words that scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe mulder to be infected since she discover s murphy s dead body even though they haven t inspected her at all to find out for sure that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood but i guess i probably would have acted rashly in that situation too but then stupid hodges decides that she has to assume mulder is infected even though mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects mulder in the process luckily she sees that it is really dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution at least as much as you can expect from an x file the government wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and mulder is left with yet another frustrating unsolved case in closing i give ice and easy 10 10 and i leave you with a haiku we re not who we are it goes no further than this it ends right here right now	1
1643	wow it s hard to put into words my feelings for this episode ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure it s my favorite of the season six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression the drama can t get any better than that paranoia reigns supreme as even mulder and scully have doubts about each other s sanity i ve heard people complain about this episode s similarities to the movie  the thing  i haven t seen it so i wouldn t know ice is more than worth watching just to see mulder and scully truly testing their still developing trust of one another this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end you won t be disappointed	1
1644	a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice isan artic locationclaustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season onethe previous occupants of the artic station mulderscully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselvesa virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fearmulder and scully actually begin to question each others sanitytension is that highthe writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense mulder and scully come into conflict in such a direct manner	1
1645	a team varied between scully and mulder two other scientists a pilot and the guy who plays bana on seinfeld go up to an arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves they discover there s a worm  a virus  that is parasitic to the point of madness and death the problem is after a certain dog lashes out anyone could be infected but who this is not just my favorite episode of season 1 but also one of my favorites from the show the arctic environment encloses the characters and of course like carpenter s the thing it s a lot of fun watching these even tempered characters suddenly start to flip out in dramatic scenes and the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy i didn t mind them at all the drama between the characters ends up working more than it would usually because of the tension and because all of the actors including the bana guy understand what s going on in the story and as usual i loved the ambiguity of the ending highly recommended	1
1646	this isn t a bad tv movie shtrafbat is short for shtrafnoy batallion which means penal batallion such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the soviet union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war these battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat they were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret or much honor on the part of military they were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties the ones who refused to fight were executed on sight needless to say their lives sucked there were some very nice performances by the cast especially by yuri stepanov who played antip aleksandr bashirov who played stirah and roman madyanov who played major kharchenko however the series isn t really that addictive in part because it s too long it could ve a lot shorter and as effective although it s about war shtrafbat has very mild violence and pretty much no gore it relies solely on the actors to make it work and after all it s a tv series so the producers didn t want to scare off the viewers and the sponsors shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the soviet regime and explaines why so many men chose to fight the nazis instead of joining them personally i d rather be a fascist then a communist given the circumstances presented in the film one character explains that the soviets stripped her farm clean and her family died of starvation out of anger she burned it down which got her arrested for destroying kolhoz property and she ended up in the penal battalion as a criminal antip reminisced on how her mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family both men explained that they fought for their motherland rather than the for the soviets the penal battalion had one marinenaval infantry who raped a girl killing her comrade in the prosess threatened her other comrade to keep her mouth shut about both ordeals and then feigned injury when it came to fighting on top of all that the girl committed suicide due to shame i imagine if enough marines watched this movie they d pick up banners and riot on the streets calling for a boycott or an official apology from the producers to say the least i d recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former soviet union or world war ii i don t think i wasted 500+ minutes of my life	1
1647	shtrafbat   penal battalion is a moving and mostly honest look at the lives and deaths of soviet soldiers who were sentenced to wash away their crimes with blood during world war two one can almost call it the russian equivalent of highly acclaimed band of brothers miniseries formed in july of 1942 on the eve of battle of stalingrad the penal battalions were considered expendable units and suffered horrible casualties sometimes as high as 90% prisoners of gulag political prison concentration camps deserters soldiers who were captured by germans but managed to escape soldiers accused of breaching protocol were all given a chance to join the shtrafbat and prove that there were not traitors of the motherland with their lives those who sustained injuries and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were reinstated in the eyes of the law this miniseries features a look at one such shtrafbat under the command of tverdokhlebov   an honorable officer who was captured by the germans was shot and left for dead it features a colorful and varied group of people thrust into a situation from which there is no escape the authoritative yet honorable crime boss antip kulak the fist and her little gang of unreformed criminals a young jewish intellectual who struck her anti semite officer father orthodox priest mikhail who joins the battalion when her parish is destroyed in the house to house fighting political prisoners who hate the regime that condemned them to the gulag but who are nonetheless willing to fight one last time for their people and country must all find their courage and their reasons to keep on living and to keep on fighting although set during a war not every episode features combat in fact what combat scenes there are are often chaotic sporadic and short   which was probably the intent of the director in between the miniseries focuses on various relationships between the cast their backgrounds their thoughts and tragedies the rape of a young woman by one of shtrafbat s soldier and then her execution execution for supposed awol periods of boredom on the march the celebration and subsequent consequences of finding a german bunker stocked with food and champagne the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors cheating on a spouse and other situations feature prominently the camera is unflinching   it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and the ugliness of human nature nor from raw human emotions the dialog likewise does not censor out the swearing the acting is superb and deep and the script is likewise well written everything from rage to weariness to resignation to finding a scrap of joy to hang on to is rendered almost faultlessly one complaint might be that some of russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone not familiar with the language and culture because it is a history drama in a sense some of the terms and situations military rank mention of other battles certain historical references may be lost on some viewers this understanding is not needed to thoroughly enjoy shtrafbat but these references are a nice touch of authenticity another complain that could be levied is an occasional anachronism and bending of history to suit the plot but frankly this is such a riveting miniseries that one will likely forgive these slight mishaps	1
1648	shtrafbat is the story only russians could tell about the second world war the largest front of the whole conflict has been ironically the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war while the western allies war effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner the east has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value there is no chance that shtrafbat could compete with band of brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind that the soldiers are russians is enough big reason to forgive the less eye captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the story that is the most interesting so much different was the war in the eastern front and the nature of the russian army that you might wish people to produce more dramatizations from the other fronts and of armies shtrafbat is no way perfect but it has some rare specialties that augment the overall rating it tends to crush myths people have about the second world war the true heroes were russian people and not their leaders who sent them to missions where they could only perish another great myth bust is that it presents the enemy who does not pick up her gun as an equal human being   an advancement that has been difficult to try in many acclaimed films as well shtrafbat shows how the war in the eastern front was a war of survival and how the clash of the  isms grinds people into dust	1
1649	many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war ii on the eastern front characters well portrayed and unforgettable one episode leaves you wishing for the next pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of shtrafbat battalions are listed an untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals sometimes brutal sometimes romantic always filled with real people and dialog produced with excellent sets and camera work heroes and villains criminals and priests patriots and traitors portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time i wish to buy a copy for my own collection so to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly	1
1650	with the war not going well for the soviet union stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops this is the story of one such battalion there are petty crooks political prisoners soldiers kicked out of other units gray haired veterans of the white army plus some dangerous criminals they are thrown into battle ill equipped untrained and face the threat of the nkvd if they show signs of cowardice or failure the special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one dimensional but the overall story is very human and riveting i have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing viewing the show required liberal use of the pause button and explanations from a native speaker of russian	1
1651	rififi directed by jules dassin is in line with the melville crime pictures particularly bob le flameur and to a point le cercle rouge of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn t need and was ahead of its time ionically it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters a kind of respect if not for selves than for others a kind of duty that rings well in post ww2 france its actors carry faces for these characters that say  we know what these guys are about  and from there the story takes off maybe it s because i have a weak spot for heist pictures particularly where we see just the nuts and bolts err actual physical side of how a heist is pulled off one of the problems with how the actual heist is filmed in today s movies is that it s all very fast ie snatch or done in ways we ve seen too many times before dassin like melville years later decided to create practically a silent film of a heist sound effects included the tension that builds up in this scene may not top what melville had in  rouge  but on its own level it achieves its own greatness and momentum and just as crucial originality to what s been done before there are some kept close ups for example as the safe is being cracked that mark some of the best i ve seen from france at that time an added plus for the film aside from the larval stage new wave touch to the film which in the end makes it a little more modern is that the story works so well and differently it becomes completely about character at points and then keeps up the thrills the last ten to fifteen minutes are down right miraculous like with another classic heist picture the asphalt jungle it s not even the last stop that matters but all about how much one will go past the call of duty putting humanism over greed you almost wonder in all the exhilaration of the camera flying by the trees at a high speed with the car that she might just make it dassin has here a very entertaining and intuitive film of its genre with a nifty little musical number as well	1
1652	fantastic movie one of the best film noir movies ever made bad guys bad girls a jewel heist a twisted morality a kidnapping everything is here jean servais has a face that would make bogart proud and the rest of the cast is is full of character actors who seem to to know they re onto something good get some popcorn and have a great time	1
1653	run don t walk to rent this movie it is re released on an excellent dvd version it is primo acting directing cinematography in the world of suspense film noir tribute this to the blacklisted american director jules dassin who also plays the italian safe cracker see it	1
1654	the ultimate gritty heist film elements of bogie welles & sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied in comparison it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films such as oceans eleven remake reviewed in such high regard especially in europe films like rififi must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic noir is criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer	1
1655	rififi is a great film that is overlooked it s a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job it s an over used story but this one is different from the others they round up the usual suspects for the job this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence around thirty minutes of silence this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense so if you re looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up	1
1656	rififi is a terrific heist movie and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since jules dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live   you will not find here the hollywood glamour of ocean s eleven the robbers in rififi don t rob for the thrill and they re not playing a game they rob to survive to pay for their children s upbringing to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world the much lauded heist scene is a nail biter filmed in virtual silence i did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to but the high speed race to deliver the child to her mother that ends the film is classic be warned   this movie is very bleak but it s also very good grade a 	1
1657	what a gas of a movie film noir has always been one of my favorite genres but this one stands apart from the rest only the big sleep out of the past murder my sweet and the killers can come close to this caper classic i know these four american films i mentioned are not caper movies per se but rather detective stories with complicated story lines which still exude a noirean gritty quality about them similar to rififi what is different here is the way jules dassin sets into motion the total ambiance of the film not only in the gritty realism of the principals but also in the usage of the streets of paris as a subliminal character and co conspirator unto itself the movie centers around le stephanois a dark moody and complicated ex con getting pulled into one last shot at the hefty payoff even though she is an unsmiling and hard nosed tough guy one still senses in her a yearning for some kind of redemption by extricating herself from the demons of her past hey she saved little toni dassin picked the right guy jean servais for that role that aside the rest of the story development kind of falls into place as we journey through the famous silent caper scene to the the eventual demise of the principal perps only their women survive except for ida mario s honey they seemed to best understand the underlying futility of it all	1
1658	to start with i have done some further research on the film firslty jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir thirdly the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers the producers of rififi asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop  it s impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film  laslty i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn t always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars	1
1659	this 1955 heist film follows tony le stephanois recently released from prison for theft as she undertakes the robbery of her life she teams up with her old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe cracker cesar from milan played by jules dassin who also directed she only directed because she had been blacklisted as a communist in the us and couldn t work in hollywood the brilliance of this film is the 1 2 hour during the robbery during all this time there is no dialogue and no music only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe this increases the suspense and draws you in they get away with several hundred million francs worth of jewels but a jewel offered to a dancer by cesar brings their haul to the attention of a trio of brutal brothers they set out to get the stash for themselves and bring misfortune in their wake great heist gangster movie but i prefer j p melville s films in this genre this movie is like some lemonade i had last night i had gone to a caribbean restaurant and the lemonade was made with sugar cane juice instead of sugar it also had a lot of ice and was heavy on the lemons leaving it fairly sour which i like the sugar cane juice imparted a subtle slightly more mellow taste to it than actual sugar and the ice made sure it was cold and refreshing as i sucked it down 75 10 http  blogmyspacecom locoformovies	1
1660	american expatriate jules dassin makes an award winning french gangster film the plot involves tony the stephanois a hoodlum just out of prison who takes her band of thieves on a $240 million jewel heist unfortunately her ex wife s relationship with a notorious gangster named grutter an italian safe cracker named cesar with a weakness for women and the missteps of her own friend jo cause the successful heist to turn into a bloody race against time as grutter holds jo s son hostage for the cash in typical crime never pays tragedy fashion the rififi in the title is explained in a song to mean slang for basically violence and sex and the full title du rififi chez les hommes means roughly some naughty in the house of men which is pretty much where the fatal flaw of the characters take place leave it to a gangster film to place most of the emphasis on the missteps on the women but this time jo s wife gets the last laugh if you could call it a laugh when she predicts all of you are just going to kill each other the characters aren t the most sympathetic and the women are mostly weak but dassin still builds an extremely well crafted suspense film out of them as they pull off a heist that requires the utmost quiet hide the goods and then attempt to survive what basically becomes a cross country cat and mouse game in the mix are some very amazing photography and a fine attention to detail in editing leading to a pacing and visual experience that well overstates the otherwise generic plot it s not only easy to see why this is held as a classic it s also easy to see why it s among the top 250 on the imdb it s suspenseful visually magnificent full of sex and violence and maintains that classy gangster attitude we film buffs like so much	1
1661	there are not many films which i would describe as perfect but rififi definitely fits the bill no other heist film has come close to it before or after the plot is simple but engrosses you it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it you care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws it s hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le st√©phanois when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony her answer and the expression on her face says it all while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movieand rightfully sothe film actually gets better afterwardthe director jules dassin knew what she was doing when she decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony s final ride towards her destiny to think that if dassin an american director had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was it certainly wouldn t have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through but she did achieve her greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us i m just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another there s no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money leave the classics alone	1
1662	you can take the crook out of the joint but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook we ve seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before and since in movies like bob le flambeur elevator to the gallows touchez pas au grisbi the anderson tapes etc too many times to mention what helps make this one one of the more notable is of course the heist itself which plays out wordlessly in real time and the demeanor of the lead bogart would think twice before crossing this guy the ironic ending is perfectly suited to this story it almost demands it all around one of the better films noir	1
1663	it s a mystery to me as to why i haven t caught up to this masterful 50s caper film ¬ñ turned brooding noir until now but i m certainly glad to report that it didn t disappoint i haven t seen any of jules dassin s american films for several years but based on this i ll probably be going back and re watching brute force and night and the city quite soon jean servais a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world weariness and coldness has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films hey there wouldn t be a story otherwise isn t coping well with the straight life an opportunity presents itself an easy multi million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men the taut filming of the robbery half an hour of total silence is what people most remember about the film of course and indeed it s pretty remarkable but i liked the half completed location of the final shootout once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white and servais  channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in her spare but brutal performance perhaps it s a bit too sentimental in the end but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn t exactly deep or thought provoking george auric s at turns modernist romantic and jazzy score is another highlight	1
1664	i have been wanting to see this since my french teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago perhaps the long wait was worth it since the criterion collection dvd restoration is impressive in its outline this movie follows the time worn script a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault the heist takes place a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all even though the heist footage is transfixing it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations   its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on giving us two movies for the price of one john servais plays the idea man tony le st√©phanois always referred to as le st√©phanois with such world weariness that she could have just stepped out of a camus novel tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re entering the life of crime until she has a highly unpleasant interaction with her ex lover who has taken up with another man where as punishment she physically whips her with a belt thankfully that scene occurs off camera but you are not likely to forget it after that sobering event since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship tony meets with two of her old partners in crime jo and mario and decides to join them in one last big heist they enlist the services of cesar an italian safe cracker   played by director dassin herself   and we are off to the heist the heist goes off without a hitch but cesar s womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned however we can understand her attraction to the nightclub singer she has fallen for since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act   it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and her family in fact jo s son refers to her as uncle i think it is partly to help jo s family that tony agrees to the heist the ending scenes where tony saves the life of jo s kidnapped son partially redeems her more brutal and amoral actions but only partially	1
1665	the fact that after 50 years it is still a highly watchable movie says a lot about it it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it i am not a big fan of this type of movies but i could watch the whole thing without being bored which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films i liked the black and white palette the excellent casting the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next and the ending like everyone else watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence which is unfortunately so underused in today s cinema	1
1666	i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007 and i see it is in development for 2011 this will be a shame as hollywood kicked writer director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist they should not have the right to remake any of her films i love caper films and film noir and this combines the best of both tony jean servais gets out after doing a nickle and after she beats up her old girlfriend marie sabouret she plans a big score with her friends mario robert manuel and jo carl m√∂hner what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers nothing is left to chance the caper goes off great but grutter marcel lupovici sends her sons robert hossein and pierre grasset after tony and the gang after blowing it with mario they kidnap jo s son lots of bullets fly before it is over a great film by a great director the standard by which other caper films are measured	1
1667	in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi eg the score and its opines one has to have nerves of steel this one apparently demands and commands it jules dassin is the master i was on the edge of my seat throughout it deserves to be better known even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954 due one supposes to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it i cannot give it enough stars	1
1668	after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite dassin i was more than excited to watch her masterpiece o word criterion rififi now i am a little bit disappointed about the story so i have at least these five questions in my mind 1 in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le st√©phanois she couldn t know if she is still alive or not but she didn t care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach her car so of course tony wasn t dead and shot her big questionmark 2 in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar stupid because before this character wasn t that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small questionmark 3after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and her wifetony and her best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they don t care for the security of joe s wife and her five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simple 4 the perfect heist of course this is the best 30min long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire extinguisher to banned the alarm also too simple 5 the grutter gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the jewels will be there then they murder mario and her wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the jewels big questionmark over all it s a good movie because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning  because of a very good actor called jean servais because of this black white fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please don t tell me this is a stunning story	1
1669	a recent re issue of the french crime film original title  du rififi chez les hommes  with its famous 20 minute silent jewel heist sequence now comes in the us in a gorgeous new print from the criterion collection with improved subtitles and some extras jules dassin was an american born julius dassin in middletown connecticut who was forced to make films in europe because she was blacklisted rififi was well publicized in the us and did well in art houses later dassin became a lot more famous in the us for  never on sunday  1960 starring her wife the greek actress and political activist melina mercouri greece was again glamorized and popularized for americans and others with anthony quinn in mihalis kakogiannis  1964  zorba the greek  which was even a big hit in cairo the new rififi dvd includes a recent interview with dassin i did not previously realize that one of the main robbers cesar the milanese was played by dassin who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable she s one of the most memorable characters a dandified italian safe cracker who speaks no french although this classic has all the trappings of french film noir  the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments shiny black cars men in suits the nightclub scenes including a dramatically filmed and lit title song performed at the club the stony faces and the gauloises in hand or mouth  i don t think it s as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as melville s films do but there s the mesmerizing robbery which still holds up today as a tour de force it goes like clockwork with a fine sense of craft and teamwork among the robbers some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with things quickly go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million dollar bangle in it has there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after  it s the wordless heist sequence that guarantees this a special place and dassin an american director who had an unusually varied and exotic career deserves full credit for that she took a novel so conventional she was going to reject it and added some key elements that make it special in the event she couldn t pass on doing the adaptation she needed the money too much jean servais who plays the lead character tony le stephanois was an actor rather down on her luck her grim face is perfect for the role she was later to play the lead in dassin s she who must die 1957 which used french actors in greece for a political tale  topkapi  is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film it pales compared to  rififi  that also got us distribution it does have a good setting but it s wasted gone all bland and bright and prettified of dassin s post hollywood oeuvre  never on sunday  with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine is the popular choice and won best film at cannes 1960  she who must die  the political choice  rififi  the genre choice an odd piece is her  phaedra  with mercouri and tony perkins 1962 purists of tough guy hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor dassin s early films which include a prison drama  brute force  1947a cop flick  the naked city  1948 and two hard core noirs  thieves  highway  1949 and  night and the city  1950 personally i tend to like french noir and american neo noir spinoffs better than the original american noir source material  hence my enduring fascination with  rififi  but dassin is rather unique in having not only made hollywood noir but then going over to paris and producing a memorable example of its fifties french derivative	1
1670	du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like uswhat director jules dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for themthat is why they adhere to a strict code of honor for them a family is not only made up of wivesmistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friendscontrary to what many might find it hard to believejules dassin has not tried to glorify crime in her film as rififi makes it clear that crime never paysit shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human lossapart from its philosophical stance rifif is worth watching for its technical finessewhile watching one of the film s most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safeone would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plansthis is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in hollywood	1
1671	as far as i am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs i am used to viewing 1   the setting is paris france 2   there is 28 minute scene with no dialog both make this movie a bit unique at least to english speaking film noir fans actually an american jules dussain shot the film so it s not entirely a european film initially i was disappointed in this after i had watched the first 40 minutes it s an expensive dvd and i was bored however once that silent segment started   the actual heist you already know what s it about the film picked up considerably and just got better and better in fact i thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist the best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography this is what makes the disc worth owning it s excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen parisand this is paris in the mid 1950s there are lots of bleak but interesting rain soaked paris streets and buildings i found fascinating to view in fact there were many more of those great shots than of london in the much better known film the third man the lead actor in here jean servais i think her name is also is interesting to view someone described her face as a cross between humphrey bogart and harry dean stanton and that sums it up perfectly a warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film this is france not the united states so there is a little bit of both in here i appreciate the dvd offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too	1
1672	if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston it also has a debt of gratitude to jules dassin a man that was ahead of her times and who suffered a lot because of her blacklisting when edward dmytryk accused her of being a communist the end of her american career would have meant the end of mr dassin but moving to europe proved she was bigger than the same people that had contributed to her hollywood demise rififi is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr dassin s vision she decided to adapt auguste le breton s novel because she saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic jules dassin was penniless in paris when she discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to her film the bad weather paid off for mr dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way when we first meet tony she is playing cards tony appears to be in bad health she coughs all the time and sweats profusely after losing all her money she goes to see jo the swede who tells her about a possibility for a robbery at maupin & webb the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris they pass the idea through mario who suggests cesar the milanese an expert safe cracker tony who has come out of prison recently learns that mado her former lover is now with grutter a creep that owns a night club upon confronting mado instead of love all she feels is contempt and the meeting ends badly and she throws her out of her place grutter has no love for tony who is her natural enemy because of her connection with mado when the day arrives the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor right above the jewelry store the owner lives but she is away everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels cesar the milanese a typical ladies  man takes a ring as a souvenir which in turn she gives the chanteuse at the grutter s night club this tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought plan jean servais made an excellent tony she showed a tired man who was possibly doing her last robbery carl mohner robert manuel and the director jules dassin are seen as jo mario and cesar the quartet jewelry thieves marie sabouret plays mado marcel lupovici plays grutter with a subdued intensity robert hussein who would go to direct movies later on makes an impression with her remi one of grutter s men the film best asset is the great camera work by philippe agostini who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from georges auric s music plays well with the action in the film jules dassin was peculiar in her choice of films that she directed and unfortunately that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with the naked city night and the city and rififi	1
1673	this film is a work of pure class from start to finish for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist forget that it s set in paris and forget it s noir the film itself the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience it s sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail just like the heist itself it portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with it s a film that doesn t glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is theft it shows that a heist is hard work and ultimately not worth doing now all things considered put on top of that a daring 28 minute sequence with not a word spoken and set in gorgeous paris with truly great attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and that last scene when you look up and see those trees wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques it is a master piece in my view and i m glad to have seen it	1
1674	the minutiae of what s involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies then there s the robbery itself a wordless thirty minute nail biter that has never been surpassed followed by what is probably the cinema s most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassin s earlier brute force there isn t a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like no one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie a classic	1
1675	or vice versa this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker jules dassin who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac the premise of the story is rather familiar  one last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and her buds  and so is the ending with everybody getting well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous the engaging  sometimes intruding  score by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties jean servais plays the hardcore consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played her tony s recently out of prison past her prime but still tough and decisive when she has to be her mind still sharp when focused the kind of anti hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall dassin plays the italian safecracker and would be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys often there are levels of bad guys the good bad guys we are identifying with and the bad bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe there s a really bad bad bad guy or two here we have remi grutter played by robert hossein a slightly sadistic druggie then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that in the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual motto following the old hollywood code was crime doesn t pay with every criminal having to pay for her or her crime before the end of the movie probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it directors like stanley kubrick louis malle and the best of hitchcock some have actually compared this to kubrick s the killing 1956 and suggest that kubrick stole a little well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist for the protagonist and having the girl gum up the works the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought oh no the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money oliver stone s u turn 1997 starring sean penn there the money in her backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast ha ha ha getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue when there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about 30 minutes worth is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out one other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera a guy gets her throat slit we don t see it i kind of like this approach we don t have to see the gore you could almost let your kids see rififi  almost catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full	1
1676	after five years in prison tony le st√©phanois jean servais meets her dearest friends jo carl m√∂hner and the italian mario ferrati robert manuel and they invite tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show window of the famous jewelry mappin & webb ltd but she declines tony finds her former girlfriend mado marie sabouret who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night club l  √¢ge d  or louis grutter pierre grasset and she humiliates her beating on her back and taking her jewels then she calls jo and mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry they invite the italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf cesar perlo vita to join their team and they plot a perfect heist they are successful in their plan but the d juan cesar makes things go wrong when she gives a valuable ring to her mistress du rififi chez les hommes is a magnificent film noir certainly among the best i have seen the screenplay has credibility supported by an awesome direction of jules dassin stunning performances of the cast and great cinematography jean servais has outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules the famous long silent sequence of the heist is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best ones of the cinema history i am listing this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever my vote is ten title brazil rififi	1
1677	i see alot of movies at the cinema 103 so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954 i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print  the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality  although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort  if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate it s a classic  	1
1678	rififi jules dassin   france 1955 to me it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood remake of jules dassin s 1955 classic rififi planned for release in 2007 al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead taking on the role of tony le stephanois risky business how they re gonna pull this off ironically dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try her luck in france and made this little masterpiece aptly called by some the grandddady of all caper  and heist movies in my opinion it remains a one of a kind classic beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film whatever one s opinion of the film in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised nevertheless this french noir classic shouldn t be forgotten go see it before the remake is out there in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two camera obscura     9 10	1
1679	rififi deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets it s a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography but rififi isn t just this one scene   every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to come cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me it s the final scene that holds the most power   tony le st√©phanois s hallucinogenic drive towards redemption	1
1680	du rififi chez les hommes rififi1955 can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston s seminal heist film asphalt jungle1950 the difference between the two films is rififi1955 pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence also the police aren t involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle in the end rififi1955 is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle1950 remarkable noir picture that defines 1950s french cinema spartacus1960 may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist but in my opinion rififi1955 was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late 40s to early 50s she got some sort of retribution when rififi1955 became a success around france and europe thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same rififi1955 is the most important film of dassin s career because it not only restored her name but also gave her a second chance at making films jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions her handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing her best and last noir rififi1955 marked the end of dassin s period in filmmaking when she was involved in doing noir pictures rififi1955 is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director jules dassin a masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film masterpieces such as rififi1955 are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the 118 minute duration the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre productions production and post production of a film shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi1955 is in committing and why very few would do something like it the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism any dialogue or and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer s patience sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that s rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing the robbery sequence of rififi1955 reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes1955 have been influenced if not inspired by it one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melvilleoriginal choice for director of rififiwho used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos1961 and le cercle rouge1970 another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing1956 also quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs1992 was inspired by this film other film directors influenced are john woo michael mann paul schrader ringo lam etc du rififi chez les hommes1955 is comparable to bob le flambeur1955 in many ways one jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi1955 and bob le flambeur1955 two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist three bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion four each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats part of rififi s charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois jo le suedois mario farrati and cesar le milanais most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with her cynical outlook and tired looks du rififi chez les hommes rififi1955 became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end	1
1681	in this election year where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office luke eberl is the writer and director of choose connor there are significant parts of the film that reveal that she is a  genius  when it comes to telling stories via the cinema go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist a mix of citizen kane advise and consent and paths of glory by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above	1
1682	the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics while the theme seems common what makes the movie is the unconventional way the story is told the characters are played with conviction you feel the innocence of the lead and her innocence lost the politician is the prince of double talk a real snake the camera work is impressive it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue ditto for the music the story uses a parable style with vingettes where the message is filled with double entendres a very canny strategy by the writer director the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes the movie was like a good mystery book something was afoot you knew it was bad you didn t know exactly what it could be   you had your suspicions and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn t noticed you were holding in saddened shaking your head a story well written and well told 3 cheers to a young writer director	1
1683	i was amazed at the quality of this film particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director   all 140 lbs of her truly a boy directing a movie about a boy i look forward to seeing more luke eberl films i did think this one was a bit too long there was too much time spent showing connor being unsuccessful and unwilling to make a move on owen caleb didn t try hard enough owen being so young could have easily become closer to caleb and later decided it wasn t her preference and owen would still have learned the valuable lesson about corruption and politics instead she didn t give herself a fair chance to learn about her sexuality and what about poor caleb owen could have been a good influence though the film intends to show owen as a hero who overcomes perverted corruption i felt sad for owen she was offered the opportunity to have some boy boy fun with caleb who was extraordinarily beautiful owen didn t have to go along with the political perversion as offered but she could have tried to have some fun with caleb and still walked away when she wanted it was clear that owen was in charge   no one forced her to do anything she didn t want to do but she could have had more fun and with a very hot boyfriend at that i hope luke makes more movies where appealing young characters have more fun	1
1684	over the many years there are some films that just slip by & hardly anyone views  choose conner is one of those films this small gem played at some festivals & had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about $ 5500 it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this it is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician who influences a very bright 15 year old ladthis politico also has a handsome nephew about 17 years old who befriends the 15 year old lad the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs so is the film & that is what i appreciated we do not get all the factsmuch is left to our own thinking you will hear dialog that makes this logical steven weber wings is our politicianhis role is slightly vaguethis is another point for the audience to ponder alex dlinz is our 15 year old she was about 17 when they made this movie but easily can pass for younger she has been in films & tv since she was a young child she is a very good actor & is quite convincing escher holloway is the older teen this role is her first major part & she too is excellent now i am saving the best for last the writer director luke eberl is not yet 23 years old for a first effort a big thumbs up i do hope she as well as our 2 lads have a long career ratings *** out of 4 86 pointsout of 100 imdb 8 out of 10	1
1685	everything about choose connor was top=drawer especially the script and the very proficient work done by the 21 year old director writer producer luke eberl    a talented young man from whom to expect great things all the acting was credible the dialogue smart the theme important loved it saw it at the 2007 woodstock film festival where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences it s more than just a coming of age movie    this kid learns a hard heartbreaking lesson about trust politics and the system    how things really work to suit the personal agendas of those in powerful positions i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain	1
1686	if there are people that don t like this movie i don t think they are human this film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of judith light s character made in 1997 this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that judith light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers this movie although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much is incredibly moving i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me the plot doesn t have much to it but the acting provided by judith light is incredible she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end you don t want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her overall a movie worth my highest praise thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty i eagerly await this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers although i don t have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago which is still hard to believe since this movie is still ingrained into my head after all this time	1
1687	an incredible performance this is one of the best films i have seen ever i know this is being said a lot but i bet you will not regret watching this film it s great from the very beginning to the last second the acting of especially the mother   played by judith light is so convincing there are not many other films i ve seen that could compare to it and it seems it s impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama there are lots and lots of movies made every year but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life   make this one of them	1
1688	when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january 2005 i didn t like it i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star judith light acted were so unlike her which of course is true and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re aired and i felt pretty much the same then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing i even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers it is a very well acted and done tv movie judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film i keep watching it over and over it s a sad movie but very good if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it it s not usually my type of movie but i did enjoy this one a+++	1
1689	the movie was certainly true to the real life story on which it was based it was hard for me to find newspaper articles about the actual facts but when i located them i could see that truth in this case was stranger than fiction judith light was frighteningly evil in her role as the mother in this movie so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role the mark i think of an excellent performance rick schroder was appropriately clueless as her son who also defended her in court an example of how hard it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept the actions of a parent no matter how criminal they may be one can find fault with the movie but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based	1
1690	a story of love between two people at the end of wwii beautifully filmed very romantic and yet rather fatalistic fable of budding love and war that would not end if you want happy endings don t watch wajda movies sweety	1
1691	there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajdathat story told about young writer who is seekin  her place after a second warhe s survive german campexcellent true atmosphereaction goes in camp for displaced placedmain heroplayed by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski finally fall in love but unfortunately her lady has been killed there was beautiful scenewhen she is talking with american soldier and says about death her girlnothing is happensimply you re shootin  to us now she s condition of soul has been destroyed 10 10	1
1692	krajobraz po bitwie like many films of wajda is perhaps not understandable for the rest of the world story based on the few short stories of tadeusz borowski who during wwii was the prisoner of oswiecim dachau and dautmergen camps borowski in her books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter tadek   porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for herself she describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation ironically after the returning to poland she stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist producing stream of anti imperialistic and anti american press publications after few years she committed suicide in the movie wajda changes point of view vorarbeiter tadek   character created by the tadeusz janczar   plays only supporting role story is focused on the poet destroyed burned out by the war and imprisonement and her one day love affair with nina jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so called dipis displaced persons life who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks marches patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and or prostituting german girls 	1
1693	aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat this film rings true on the chaos of the post war beautiful photography and a powerful national expression of the polish national character it s very slow at points but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it s quite refreshing both lead actors do a very good job on the dvd version you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew and the lead actress stanislawa celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty but in 1970 she was a stunner	1
1694	in landscape after the battle andrzej wajda in the second era of her filmmaking career depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi prison in poland freed immediately after the wwii a hand held camera explores a lot of extreme close ups and vivid colors the end credit as graffiti on flanks of freight train cars symbolically concludes the film the soundtrack is great except vivaldi which sounds tacky in pop art fashion in the opening sequence	1
1695	landscape after a battle opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences   in rather funny movements accompanied by vivaldis four seasons a touching opening but we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob and when they also treated humouristic burry a man alive the protagonist stops for a moment but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about her neighbour the rest of the film is set in an american camp from where the prisoners are not released in some kind of semi freedom semi camp a perfect set for a study of war criminality american camps polish nationalism catholisism grief and human misery in general film makes an important turn in comes women and with them film changes light colour and temper at the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in holocaust i think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind s treatments of jews under and after the world war and not only the nazi exterminations but mankind letting it happen   and even forcing them out of europe after the war on an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come how environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences  but the film is a carpet of underlying contradictionshumour irony and sudden beauty a couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp an emotional tune brutally rejected filmatically speaking by the protagonist that example picks up an important essence of the film s style and theme when it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back her glasses in crowds in hay stacks etc its not hard to understand spielberg s respect of wajda when you see this film the great treatment of light can be compared with spielberg on her best the grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty anyhow there is also another scene i can t let go without comment its the christian supper undoubtly ironical but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment everybody falling on their knees while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy her bells are mocking the scene but also gives it emotion and love when nina gets her bread sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric its the peak moment of the film main actors are excellent in their roles olbrychski as the perfect wajda protagonist   the doubting reflecting mind unable to put all the aspects of her mind and emotion into life beautiful celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements those who try to describe everything often are unable to take nothing in consideration this is what wajda manages her films are either very moving deep or beautifully shot but pays attention to life s and society s particularity a moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second the moment of grief for the third a moment of nothing for the fourth there is at least two reasons to pay attention to wajdas films of this period first is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact this country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that kusturica has rose to grandeur	1
1696	of course i am going to think it was a great movie i recognized several people i didn t see during filming also i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette i also changed this one scene they had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn her around and walk her out the director said it is taking to long what would you do gower i said we need to go in and hook the arms and drag her out backwards that way your camera can stay on her face as we take her off set i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security i am also a current employee with the tennessee deaprtment of corrections as a supervisor at the riverbend maximum security institution even though a lot of the movie was a joke the part i was in was reality enough also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called the classic cat	1
1697	andy mcdermott tom everett scott is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with her friends brad and chris andy saves serafine pigot the gorgeous julie delpy from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her she does not know that she is a werewolf they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf she is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked her and eating its heart this movie is a violent black humor movie the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent highlighting the song of the band bush i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece  an american werewolf in london  the stories have nothing in common only an american teenager werewolves and a city in europe highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies my vote is seven title brazil um lobisomem americano em paris an american werewolf in paris	1
1698	is it full moon tonight oh it doesn t matter they can change whenever they want cuz of that drug what was i thinking if its full moon tonight geez i really like this movie there s romance suspense horror and hot stuff  i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by bungee jumping and catching her that was really cool the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france the cemetery scenes are nice it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who s behind the walls the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool even they got me on that scenes her friend who died and the girl whom she killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead charactersorry i forgot her name was really funny the actors did a good job plus the make up crews the part when they re all partying in an abandoned church i can t believe people would that because even though that s an abandoned church that is still god s house i bought this movie long time ago and i do not regret buying it i m a horror movie lover i give this movie 5 stars out of 6 for the people who are open and loves movies like this give it a try you might like it	1
1699	this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it`s more enjoyable than the original  maybe that`s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it`s a good not great movie most if not all fx were done by cgi which i didn`t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie phil buckman   chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria dario argento`s movie thats to name but two this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people`s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i`ll get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil buckman   chris should have been in it more than she was but apart from that the movie was fine rating for this movie 8 10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there 	1
1700	i have never seen american werewolf in london but this movie was very entertaining when renting it i thought it was a horror movie but it turned out to be more of a comedy with some horror aspects i thought the transformation sequences were nicely done but effects wise the best scenes were those where the effects and the lighting built off each other nice the transformations reminded me a lot of werewolf transformations in other movies but the werewolves themselves are very beastly and not very dog like gore i do believe there is too much in this movie which really takes away from the horror when every frame has blood in it taking the violence seriously is hard  jhurst 8th grade	1
1701	ok most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake but at the same time it s also a different movie in its own right don t get me wrong  american werewolf in london  is a superior film but  american remake in paris  is a decent movie as well first off the only real similarities are the title 2 american backpackers and werewolves other than those 3 things  american remake in paris  stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor action adventure and horror most of the people who say this film is better than the original are the youth of today s generation that think any movie made before 1990 is total crap while those of us who grew up in the 80 s can appreciate older films and what they have added to the horror films of today what a lot of people fail to realize is that without the old classic films including the b&w ones horror wouldn t be what it is today now i m getting a little off the beaten path an american werewolf in paris is a good attempt at re creating a classic but it will never surpass the original ever with that said this is still a very entertaining film to watch and i do recommend it i m giving it a 7 out of 10 maybe that s being a little generous but i ve seen much worse attempts at trying to re create a classic	1
1702	i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london & paris let me start by saying london still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of gorenow lets get to paris its enjoyable a few scars lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it s time the transformations al a cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike her performance only to end up liking itgo figurejulie delpy was competent as was the direction it s the script that lacked a bit of shine & finesse i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad she didn t i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether i also noticed some discussion of a sequel what if well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title an american werewolf comes home or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare you simply must see the original in it s new dvd transfer with dolby 51 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned onnice	1
1703	the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren t even mentioned in this movie by name so as a sequel aawip fails one would say i dare to say the opposite an american werewolf in paris is a charming effective horror movie it s one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too and i have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling wolfen the wolfman and the underworld trilogy the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed i really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely i didn t really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that  the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesn t look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but let s just say that i wasn t disappointed there s also a good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it s predecessor but it s still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars	1
1704	three american lads are backpacking their way around europe challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot babe lays as they can but andy seeks true love she finds this during their bungee jump attempt on the eiffel tower when she comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart burstingly beautiful julie delpy her attempts to find this girl and the secret she uncovers lead she and her friends into an fast paced adventure full of action romance gore and inspired humor without ever taking itself to seriously or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride i have seen this film a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the  london  original although both films are so different it is not fair to compare the two or even to consider this a sequel	1
1705	i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner an american werewolf in london that film had it s funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn t in the same classbut it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it s still fun to watch  so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version i ll still give it decent marks since i don t care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too  the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i don t see enough of this actress she doesn t seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no f words and no lord s name in vain   amazing however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn t appealing to a middle aged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20 somethings if that helps anyone it s entertainingjust don t expect it to live up to the first film	1
1706	to paraphrase thora birch i kind of like this movie it s the exact opposite of everything i hate in a film this obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign and a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens   where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience whoever heard of a mature teen movie but if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the dvd you could do a lot worse my teacher s wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings jason london as high school senior todd boomer is the star and fits this character as well as her parts in the man in the moon and dazed and confused she is helped out by exceptional work from her supporting cast tia carrere in the title role is a revelation she can act as todd s calculus tutor and love interest christopher mcdonald as the teacher in a nice self parodying performance zak orth and alexondra lee as todd s best friends and jeffrey tabor as her father  as someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful at least by traditional happy ending standards even todd s parents are indifferent to each other with her father panting after the title character and her mother leslie lyles literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance the london carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find  but the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends there is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing they actually manage to pull off a believable three person relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history  then again what do i know i m only a child	1
1707	tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film as neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film ¬ñ which goes to show me and everyone that a dvd shouldn t be judged by it s cover ***spoilers*** the film felt like it was trundling along not really going anywhere for the moment ¬ñ the awkwardness of paul faber zak orth around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck as alexondra lee being too school girlish to watch where those really fashionable in 1995 the relationship between vicky mueller tia carrere and todd boomer jason london was tantalising from the start of though that first meeting across the lake ¬ñ magical what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as she has behaved like a complete moron boomer with two o s as in moron¬Ö in front of alexondra a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was well¬Ö the title did give that away wouldn t you think what really surprised me was the acting especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of her alter ego the dog character in the little white jewellery box the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss ¬ñ point of no return for todd and vicky a shame really that the film ends with focus on after getting over todd s fathers harvard drive her re uniting with her friends i could envision a whole new film ¬ñ following vicky to new york ¬ñ there must be a good art university there that todd could attend nevertheless a film that does just what we want hollywood to entertain us for the duration of the film did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film todd s mother is slightly insane on the phone 24 7 her dad doesn t find her attractive any more todd s teacher obviously is disenchanted by her wife and vice versa ¬ñ todd herself enters into a wonderfully erotic & daring relationship which however nice it may be would realistically be very difficult to maintain age difference maturity difference etc and alexondra & zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship  > her reactions towards the condom the cheating zak s advances etc are all very immature and often involve running away and zak herself the poor guy ¬ñ is too much of a best friend like a brother guy to pull even alexondra mind you good film though i gave it an 8 10 brilliant performance by the actors   who bring the script to life	1
1708	as talk shows go larry king live is not bad and since she occasionally gets good guests it s a show to turn on once in awhile but not compulsively when bill maher carl bernstein a former president or other substantive guests sit across from her it s not too bad other times she tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and tv stars during the oj simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on her show was related to the case but is this really journalism or the national enquirer on the tube sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash television  jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience on the other side king s show is definitely much better than bill o reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest political platform of the rush limbaugh variety that said larry king is not a bad interviewer but alas she is not a great one king does not always come off like she completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics always seems like the minute king can t quite deal with the issue at hand that s when she turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than she has she might interview someone like david gergen but may not have read any of her books sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script when it s an entertainment celebrity no problem she can come off like she s thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science and i notice she usually has seen the star s latest movie watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book however if it s the likes of john dean or bob woodward king comes off a little like she didn t quite finish her homework so off to the phones if you are looking for real in depth interviewing terry gross of npr is probably the best interviewer in the united states she reads and or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas i don t see king quite doing that granted she probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross which may say more about the american audience than king in short larry is better than bill but not as good as terry	1
1709	i ve been a fan of larry king s show for awhile i think she does a terrific job overall and i don t think she ever  wusses  out as so many people seem to believe she s a subtle scorpio she gets her zings in when she needs to just as she managed to do last night with paris hilton during her first post jail tv interview the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge sauer gave her what she believes was a too harsh sentence and what s more actually made her serve it  in all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge sauer saw fit to impose on her she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she 1 showed up late in court for the original hearing and 2 proceeded to inform her when she asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that i have people who read that sort of thing for me  all the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action showing up late and that statement    and more importantly the attitude   the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed    just might have made judge sauer pardon the pun go sour on her  last night on king s show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered her question do you think you got a raw deal with a resounding yes and during the course of the conversation if you can call it that she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her king asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much stared at her blankly she basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she s been victimized in this situation she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge i feel this is very sad   tragic even considering what a huge role model hilton is to some people and it renders anything she said last night about her so called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness contradiction and hypocrisy  during the course of the interview hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible at the end of the interview king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes completely superficial non insights which she had read on air as if she were nelson mandella or something and finally grunting out i don t have a favorite passage  judge sauer in my book is a hero and after last night so is larry king for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is	1
1710	saturday afternoon is one of harry langdon s best known short subjects and with good reason it is one of her funniest and best films the plot    such as it is    is an old staple a hen pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a her pal and a couple of other girls it s a solid and well used comedy plot but the difference here is harry langdon herself her slow ineffectual befuddled innocent character has somehow floundered her way into a marriage with a woman who feels that she of all people must be ruled with an iron fist and she is only thrust into cheating on her because she can t say no to the exhortations of the chummy vernon dent and the cute eyelash fluttering of the girl  it s a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless childlike character harry doesn t want to cheat but she can t do anything about it in a wonderful bit of comic business she can t bring herself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye she slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and ashamedly wipes off her hand as if to chastise it the film is a three reel comedy ten minutes longer than the two reelers harry langdon had previously been starring in for mack sennett with no more plot perhaps it was even designed to be a two reeler this works beautifully since it gives her as much time as she needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half actions where so much of her comedy lives  she s at her best here and the show is really harry langdon s curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing her little half  smiles her look while handling the money she has hidden under the rug childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end i think her comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us yet at the same time by allowing us to understand what harry does not such as the fact that the women she good heartedly brings to her friend to cheer her after she thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores she forces her to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore her comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say awwww as it is making us laugh often at once  here harry wants to refuse to cheat on her wife she wants to tell her wife whose boss and take some power back in her relationship she wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film but she just can t affect her surroundings that much and sometimes we all feel like that  the film is perfectly directed by frequent langdon director harry edwards it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry langdon s still reactive comedy vernon dent a frequent foil to langdon plays one of the roles here where she becomes almost a comedy partner in her very effective pairing with harry the gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too and harry gets her own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end here the comedy is not in harry s big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars but in her slowness to take it in  this is a hilarious film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that i know ever to have existed	1
1711	if as i just pointed out in the goat keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law this langdon short the last released before she did tramp tramp tramp was based on another comic ploy   being married to a shrewish spouse and trying to get away for some secret two timing dating laurel & hardy did this in several films as did fields and chaplin  i have a problem with it   why do these characters always marry such nasty women and there is an interesting sociological side issue   why don t you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews i can t recall any except in a carol burnett skit where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get a kind of mutual sado masochism but also reassurance that their not married to a namby pamby type as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve or do they ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at her yeah she went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans but she wanted to get some private time   there is nothing suggesting she and stan cheated on their wives actually she is creamed by mae busch because she lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to her wife here harry s wife alice ward is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps her under strict control we see harry at her job it is saturday morning and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend   this was before the idea of a five   day a week 40 hour a week job in industry she works in a foundry where she hits red hot metal into shape an early joke about langdon   she is a small light man not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer she just misses her streetcar trying to give a man a light she calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late  on the way home harry meets her pal steve vernon dent who has met two nice sweet girls who would just love to have a date harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl she agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the foursome   she has a 1926 silver half dollar in her pocket but her plans seem derailed when her wife discovers her hidden cache of coins she keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug but her wife spies on her and confiscates all of it later she overhears her talking to herself and berating her in contempt she gives her back a dime and says she can treat her date to a soda but harry has a second cache of coins and dresses up for the date   and goes out she and dent are apparently late and dent blames harry but harry tries to make it up to her she produces two prostitutes they get into a quarrel when dent wisely says they are not the type of girls she d term as nice eventually the girls do show up and the date begins but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat as her wife drives past in her roadster and the girls boy friends turn up   angry at their two rivals the short works well and is amusing and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in her brief stardom as a comic master she is constantly put upon by others she misses her streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light and in the end the stranger gets her own the nice girl who is harry s date has a little dog who chases her away she rests between two cars that both start driving away and she ends up wrapped around a pole it certainly demonstrates that langdon had her screen persona down pat by the time that she made her features if only she could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features	1
1712	harry langdon s saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keaton s cops or chaplin s the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesn t offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion it s a perfectly charming comedy in its minor key way and harry is fascinating to watch for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spin offs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under her wife s thumb try to sneak out with a couple of good time girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls  tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical she was odd starting with the fact that she looked like a middle aged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgy faced baby man and her stern gently domineering mommy wife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches her in the act and forces her to hand it over you d swear you re watching an interaction between a 6 year old boy and her mama    and maybe that s why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still does but she s a compelling screen figure and it s not what she does so much as the way she does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off her paces until she finds the right spot and her technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not she makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of her own where the plot of her films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward herself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harry s co star vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punch drunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with her feet on the other while they race through the streets it s a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdon s screen persona quite perfectly she s a passive figure who somehow finds herself in the middle of frantic action blinking sleepily while the world rushes past it s also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel & hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdon s style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially here saturday afternnon and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression that s hard to shake	1
1713	i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago so when the new one came out i just had to check it out i was so pleased   with the characters the story lines the updated look i became hooked from season 1 27 for the old fans through to season 2 28 it just keeps on getting better it ties in nicely with the old shows too although you don t have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version even though there has been a change of cast i highly recommend doctor who   with chris eccleston and with david tennant i like that they ve given the characters so much depth the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series maybe because she is the last timelord the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable and i felt their pain anger and sense of adventure right along with them  billie piper rose brings a very human element to each episode although she is much braver than i would be with her talent billie will go far in the industry	1
1714	for those with access to the bbc or the cbc this has proved to be spectacular like battlestar gallactica this is a show rebuilt from the ground up but in the case of dr who they saved the best parts i can t believe i am saying this but this is by far the best dr who this has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history the new doctor is easily the equal of the great tom baker and the writer former qaf lead seems to have made even the minor characters come alive i knowi m gushingbut this should be on everyone sci fi geeks list i just don t know why it hasn t made its way here whatever you doif you ever loved dr who or sci fisee this	1
1715	one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressive sci fi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twenty something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls herself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a tardis disguised a 50s style police call box she helps her save the world  there wouldn t be a show otherwise  and decides to join her but when she puts her life in danger she is distraught and questions whether her company was worth the risk although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart well written work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here	1
1716	russell t davies has been tasked with re creating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the sofa watching scary monsters battle with dr who she and her crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene rodenberry s original concept far more believable russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of her illustrious predecessors time will tell but tonight seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth sladen who was the doctor s companion in the 1970 s confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the no 1	1
1717	if you re a long time fan of the doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series rest easy    it more than meets the high expectations of the original the pacing is much quicker than the original shows fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes the writing is excellent the acting superb the hardest   and best   thing to get used to is the production values of the new series compared to the original it s got some now although i will always have fond memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet monsters if you re not a fan or if you tried the original and couldn t get a handle on it jump in with both feet now everything you really need to know about the doctor they ll tell you as they go along this series was written with minimal references to the doctor s enormous back story specifically to encourage new viewers admittedly i m only seeing the first new series now as it s being shown on the sci fi channel in other words probably cut to ribbons for time constraints but i m looking forward to future episodes either on broadcast tv or on dvd july 4th can t come soon enough	1
1718	as a fan of the old doctor who and after the mediocre fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i did yes some episodes aren t as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes eccleston s doctor is far from any we ve had before but eccleston s doctor is just about the best there is her performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic this and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest camille coduri is also fantastic as rose s mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously this series is incredibly powerful especially considering its sci fi i mean who d have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this how many times in this series  history have we had moments like those with rose s dad the emergency doctor and the  you were fantasticso was i  final speech i advise anyone whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd it truly is fantastic now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new cybermen i have to say that david tennant s doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but i don t think her doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of sarah jane & k9 was a fantastic episode a true gem not to say this series is not good just not quite as good so whether you like it or not and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston the doctor is back and she s here to stay fantastic   almost as many fantastic s as the doctor  	1
1719	i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr who i ve played them over and over i adore each of the doctors for different reasons but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy dr who was canceled even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line up with the departure of sylvester mccoy the doctor stayed alive through the fans bbc graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons the momentum of dr who has been steady even after 1989 then they took a chance with paul mcgann the movie was flawed but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted in 1999 the man was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back it was a complete success here in america the sci fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr who mythology for new viewers it is incredible to me that they have done it in season 1 staring christopher eccleston with russell t davis as lead writer and phil collinson as producer the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is the doctor who universe has always been about choice love and sacrifice this is what they provided it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr eccleston has chosen to leave the show my first doctor was doctor no 3 jon pertwee s doctor mr eccleston needn t worry about her position in the dr who universe it is as solid as the rest she is the 9th doctor i didn t know of mr eccleston prior to her performance in dr who but i do now i wish there was some way she could know there is push out in the dr who fan community to find her other work and enjoy it we have already seen that she is a great actor	1
1720	i love pop culture but i was a little apprehensive when i first heard about this then i seen an episode and i love it i was a little upset when i found out that christopher eccelson would no longer be playing doctor who she was probably the best one they ve had she fits the character so well it s sad to see her go i really don t think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as eccelson i think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures such as the darleks the story lines and characters can more than make up for that i m currently waiting for season two and i will review that as well in case for any reason quality goes down anyways i think everyone should try to see one episode i did and i have been loving it ever since well written well casted and well produced this show is worth the hour of viewing doctor who gets a 10 10	1
1721	first off i have been a fan of the show back when my pbs station started showing it back in 1981 i learned many things about the show and the people who were in or contributed to the show this latest installment of doctor who made a great impression on me the original series aka classic series was made fun of by the bad special effects and or wobbly sets well this is no more true the special effects are awesome but what is even better is the writing you get a chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and maybe a bit of a reason why she loves the planet earth so much without giving too much away it is a very worthwhile series to watch christopher eccelston brought a side of the doctor that we never get to see a bitter and angry one but yet lovable at the same time a must see	1
1722	i love dr who so much i believe that david tennant is the best dr the show has ever had and billie piper the best companion i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing her love for rose it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons i will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without rose but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch her play this fantastic role i rate this show 110% it is fantastic the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love the world and relationships from this show therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time	1
1723	i was like watching it right and i was all like oh this is so totally awesome full and then i was all like ya quite good indeed so i really enjoyed all the amazing dangers and all the british people and i think that the doctor is very a good doctor in her way of doing such wonderful doctor y things and she was a very strange man and i was like maybe i won t like this guy because hes a new doctor and i like the old doctor thats not this guy but then i watched her and i was like oh this is awesome and i liked it so then i watched and enjoyed the great evil enemies and the great conquering of the evil guys and the happy doctor who is quite scary and happy looking	1
1724	i write this after just seeing the latest episode broadcast in the uk and to me it must be a tough job to keep up the standard the last episode shown called blink has elements of gothic horror all to do with statues that aren t quite what they seem the doctor and martha don t appear much but that doesn t detract from a well crafted episode the general standard has built to a high level and the last three episodes the two parter with the family and the latest have to me been the best that the current team have ever done it s not just david tennant holding it together the whole supporting cast week in week out are helping as well for those awaiting series 3 abroad the wait is is well worth it	1
1725	i m a next generation personi ve never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21 st century the new doctor who started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci fi channel or bbc america from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler billie piper and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher eccelson misspelled last name sorry these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the worldevery now and then they have companions from rose s ex boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack harkness who can now be seen on the spin off torchwood from season one to season two the pace is just about rightthe stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy in season two she becomes different and changes and now the new doctor david tennant continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn t as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening companion role to martha played by the very sexy freema agyeman who helps continue the fight to save mankindseason three now is more on the action adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the attractiveness can be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she s not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don t really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can t mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and martha s relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base i ve seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don t have to take my world for itstep into the tardis and join the adventure	1
1726	unlike most people who ve commented i was born after the last sylvester mccoy episode and so couldn t have compared the two centuries of doctor who at first i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series i have since then seen old episodes of doctor who and some where great but like the doctor the series needed to regenerate to continue the 21st century doctor who s are great i thought martha was great almost a match for the doctor and if jack s appearance is anything to go by she s going to be brilliant when she cameos in series 4 or 5 speaking of jack the spin of torchwood is also brilliant and you should watch both of these programmes though this is definitely more suitable for kids however if you insist that this isn t the same and just isn t doctor who please just stay in your basement 10 10	1
1727	as soon as the credits rolled on saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was most definitely back watching those iconic moments where christopher eccelston met billie piper was the beginning of a huge long adventure with this new series it brings with it substences in which the previous version of the show lacked for instence the emotion between the doctor and her companion which they seemed to dismiss in the old series as well as the doctor actually falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return yet as we know the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of season 2 proved she could not stay with a companion forever watching those moments your eyes filling with tears as the doctor says her final farewell to the only companion she has ever loved were moments beautifully written and acted this show however proved it can live on as the doctor meets many other companions along her lonely yet exciting journey through her never ending life openeing new doors and secrets every episode it s a sure show for the family to enjoy as christopher eccelston once described the show the journey of a lifetime	1
1728	honestly i don t really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thing christopher eccleston is perfect in the role easily as good as tom baker rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or leela i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed   no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus and it adds something to the character to be the only one left the sfx are outstanding   especially in comparison to the original take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek   i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd	1
1729	okay i grew up on who but haven t loved a doctor since tom baker christopher eccleston made me love who again and i ll be furious with her forever for leaving  the writing is grand the acting superb the directing which was dreadful in the old days is just fantastic i was very skeptical about this programme and watched it merely out of being forced but am now a huge fan and love it i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming exterminate then  a few of the things i love about the new programme    1 people actually notice when rose billie piper disappears off the planet some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while and then come home like nothing has happened no one noticed 2 chris eccleston s doc loves rose    romantic or not will be debated but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares about her companion she d destroy the world if she had to to save her which the old show was lacking    often a doctor wouldn t care if she never saw her assistants again 3 they talk and think like real people    when rose is shown something outlandish or new such as aliens she acts like a real person would    gobsmacked i never liked it when an assistant from the old show who never saw anything alien would just fit right in and adapt instantly i want to see the surprise on rose s face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life she gives that to me  the few things i don t like about this series 1nearly everything happens on earth london or cardiff and i was sort of hoping for a more off world sort of show 2 that eccleston left so quickly she really made the show brilliant  but i can let those few things go    i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to so i don t mind if they have stuff set on earth  just don t take this show seriously    it s fun it s smart it s entertaining but it s not a super serious heavy duty show it s pure fun and pure british and i can t get enough watch it with an open mind and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy ps    don t watch series 2 or later series 1 was brilliant the first few episodes of series 2 were good but don t watch it once it gets to love and monsters utter rubbish completely destroys the show	1
1730	i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing upgot introduced to the doctor by way of john pertweeas well as camera copies of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts i had a great time w  the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously   i mean as seriously as a sci fi show about a time traveler could be i went to the cons did the costume bit doctor#56 and tegan were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a 25year old antique that drifted into the ethos when i heard that the sci fi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what i ve been babbling on about all these years and know what the heck a tardis is i have several phone boxes and tardises of various sizes around the housei didn t expect the excellent quality of story character development and f x i was to say the least   pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasn t a curmudgeon a clown a fop a trip head a pussy or a jerk christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to datenow now calm down tom baker fans don t get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and her quirks but christopher gave something to the doctor that she d never had before   real word believability i m just sad that she decided against another season i ll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor but now the bar has risen bad wolf rules 2008 update   i love david tennant her mod persona is something that my generation remembers my son s generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax she s a little more human than christopher but not as humas as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble it s still the best ride on tv	1
1731	doctor who is amazing it is everyones  cup of tea  it must be the boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around  billie piper was extraordinary as rose tyler she was so emotional and made rose so real david tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch but now billie has left and rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on off boyfriend mickey and her mother and father she died when rose was a baby but this pete tyler is from the parallel universe it will be very strange with martha being the new companion as i have only ever seen it with rose apart from the runaway bride with catherine tate freema better be good but nobody can beat rose	1
1732	i have just watched the season 2 finale of doctor who and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves on the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas also some of the special effects all though on the main very good on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished it was a huge gamble for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing so roll on to the christmas 2006 special the 2005 christmas special was by far the best thing on television	1
1733	as a child i was never in a situation where i could be introduced to dr who and though i had heard of the series in passing i never really realized exactly what it was it was then with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth doctor and her antics having be told that she was something like arthur dent from the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy but cooler i can t believe what i ve been missing out on seriously why had no one told me about this before my entire childhood was deprived of doctor who adventures me being a tremendous fan of most sci fi and fantasy adventures honestly i thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to any future episodes i have to admit that at first i was not so sure that billie piper would be the best actress but i m happy to say that she did very well i thought and added a very realistic touch to the series i think actually that was one of my favourite aspects of the series the contrast between great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the infuriating normality of the south london council estate life i m always interested in instances where people s ideas about the world are drastically challenged and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds so that it may fit in with their mundane lives i also loved christopher eccleston i haven t seen many of her films and i ve never seen another actor as dr who but i thought her portrayal of the doctor was brilliant immensely likable and yet dark enough to make you wonder i find that many other characters with her sort of character history tend to be a bit two dimensional they have all the right emotions and actions but they always seems slightly shallow this doctor on the other hand earned my loyalty with her stratified personality i agree with some of the other comments that a higher budget for the special effects aliens and whatnot might have been a bit more effective but then again this isn t about special effects though they help from what i ve read and heard from long time dr who fans it s the spirit of the whole things that really counts and i don t think they did a bad job with what they had i quite liked all the aliens but my favourite had to be the daleks if i ever knew anything about dr who before watching the series it was that there were things in it that looked like upturned dustbins on wheels previous to watching i was quite sceptical about these pepper pots threatening the existence of humanity but some of them were quite scary which i lovedof course overall a good show i look forward to future episodes with delight the doctor has a new fan	1
1734	i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellenttheir entitled to that opinion but the new series isn t quite there yet it s getting there it s definitely good first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was aired one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to cancel in the 70 s and 80 s however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it s good it s still not excellent because it does have it s flaws some of the stories dalek were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including boomtown now the other bad things the companion rose billie piper isn t great she s actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part christopher eccleston is pretty respectable she s started to catch her niche she tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but she s taken it much more serious and it shows continuity wise there still some issues that didn t get resolved well paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but she didn t get put back aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i haven t missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series	1
1735	2005 will go down in  drwho  history as its most incredible year everything seemed to click a first rate new doctor and companion big audiences  10 million for the first episode and christmas special  major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the daleks  seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell quitting after just one series it looked like the honeymoon was over luckily the public appears to have embraced her successor the excellent david tennant on top of this the show boasts fine sfx like the spaceship crashing into  big ben  in  aliens of london  and superb story lines such as  tooth & claw   army of ghosts doomsday  the new  drwho  is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century some fans have accused russell tdavies of  ruining  the show they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until she came along	1
1736	i seriously enjoy dr who seriously don t just dismiss me as a sci fi person because i m not normally i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it it is actually really funny and more often than not it s fast paced all of my family watch it pretty much and that s a miracle christopher ecclestion is pretty good but david tennant is brilliant i think it s because she made the doctor so manic and it s just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again i don t know what it is about it but everything manages to work like clockwork  all i m going to say is just try it one episode probably best if you don t pick the second half of a two parter though	1
1737	it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it  bigger and better  but i d heard these rumours in the press before and thought that s all they were   rumours  but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role   christopher eccleston  yes that christopher eccleston an actor i ve always been impressed by since watching her film debut in let her have it and if she was getting interviewed on television it must have been true  as the months passed more and more information was leaked  billie piper was being cast  the daleks would be returning and the mill  the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show  for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series  massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show  tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter  mastermind  which had a special doctor who night edition   this morning and friday night with johnathan ross  in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television  it had better be bloody good  so was it bloody good  undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts  to give you clue of its rating success only one episode  the ark in space episode two   febuary 1975  from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart  the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there s far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice  let s laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time  celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec s saturday night takeaway  of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role  for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you ll see in a spielberg   hollywood movie  there s a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands  exotic aliens  a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen  i promise you ll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series  joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list  there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies  it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not  in my opinion they re not  but what s not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd  as i mentioned in my review of casanova she cheats the audience and she does the same thing here when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at her the doctor bellows  attack plan delta  which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows her to escape from a tight spot  a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser she s been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings  in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the  bad wolf  is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor  and of the endings i m trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor  more often than it s a supporting character or the doctor s companion who saves the day  the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like she did in the classic series  one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way she s written as a grinning loon  eccleston is best known for her serious and gloomy roles and she s absolutely breath taking at scenes when she s showing grief  like the tear running down her face in the end of the world but more often than not she s written as a  tom baker on speed  character  it s obvious why eccleston hasn t done much comedy in her career   she s not very good at it  am i starting to sound like i hate this show  sorry i didn t mean to but it s just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven t and they re nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who  let s see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s  imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne  oh and one last request   can we see these  next time  trailers scrapped  they reveal all the best bits of next week s episode	1
1738	i never saw doctor who before at least not in any focused way so i was new to the concept i have to say that the new show works very well it s funny it really also ought to say comedy in the genre description many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value it s well written and it s making a meager budget go a long way the human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current tv shows i ve seen the first eight episodes and #6 8 were my favorites so far even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up with time travel saving one s dead parents and that sort of stuff works out amazingly well here christopher eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light hearted though occasionally morose doctor   if they can find a good replacement for her i ll be quite surprised but i m willing to give the new guy a chance there s little doubt however that the eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics the relationship between the doctor and rose is particularly refreshing the doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual a good show the biggest drawback is the low budget   a show like this ought to have better special effects and why they don t simply use some cheaper effects i don t know in this day and age sfx don t have to cost a bundle   just look at the star wars revelations fan film 8 out of 10	1
1739	i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid waiting for dr who i thought it was the best show ever made then i grew up dr who went off the air and no one i knew had ever heard of it then i found out there was going to be a new series i was a little nervous about it was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little would they screw it up would the dr suck would her assistant suck would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr and her assistant yes no no no no this show is wonderful i love the new dr i love her assistant i love the show and i find myself excited on friday nights now waiting for the new episode i m just now seeing 2005 episodes as i live in the states so i m a little behind the rest of you i hope the next dr is as great as this one	1
1740	first off i never got into dr who until recently honestly i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations pun intended since it was never big here in the us as it is everywhere else that said i must say obviously that after finishing the 2nd season that this is one of the best sci fi shows i ve ever seen now i watch a lot of sci fi shows from all over and this show stands out the first season was tops to begin with with christopher eccleston in the title role and i thought she was terrific of course so was the lovely billie piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one could ve done it better let s not forget camile coduri as jackie and noel clarke as mickey ricky who are just a blast to watch then there s david tenannt at first i thought she was too gawky looking to play the character her ears but after watching the 2nd season she fits in just fine her sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless she s great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eye aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine the production and direction of the show is top notch occasionally there ll be some cheesy effects here and there but that s always been a factor in the original series and like those episodes is negligible my favorite thing of all about the series the stories writing folks is always the key to great entertainment russell t davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job they ve managed to bring excitement ingenuity intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog i also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older doctors  past story lines and enemies well my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show and respectfully i won t mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the sci fi channel just started airing the 2nd season i wouldn t want to spoil it it s so much fun and excitement you ll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog it really is that good ps thanks to the producers for nicholas briggs back **exterminate**	1
1741	i loved this show such talent and i am so disappointed that it is canceled after only just beginning i looked forward to this show all week long and so sorry for the people who were hoping to be the one i would have loved to see who would have won it just began and in my opinionit should not have been canceled i hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts and have the opportunity to reach their goals i voted and sat waiting for it to come on never knowing that it was canceled and i could not believe that it was i am amazed that it had low ratings because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on tv	1
1742	i was really beginning to enjoy this show it just started out slow and it wasn t given the chance it deserved it is summertime so many people are not at home watching television i know there are a few talent and singing competitions but i enjoy them as do many other believe it or not when american idol is done for the year i miss it even though this was not american idol i thought it had potential i feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me i wish they would reconsider and put the show back on i think it was a hasty move to cancel my only complaint about the show is i did not care to much for the judges	1
1743	i was very disappointed when this show was canceled although i can not vote i live on the island of aruba i sat down to see the show on tuesday and was very surprised that it didn t aired the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled it s true not every one was as much talented as the other but there were very talented people singing i find it very sad for them that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down its a pity ariette croes	1
1744	this is a very modest very lovely movie with a great score by hoagy carmichael and frank loesser with a standout number we re the couple in the castle that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to penthouse serenade just as the opening premise hoppity s coming may well have inspired fred saidy and yip harburg s opening woody s coming in finian s rainbow six years later i totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name disney appended to this it would by now have achieved  classic  status rather than have fallen into neglect it s wonderfully inventive never more so than when objects barely noticed in the  real  world assume a much greater significance   both pro and con   in the insect world actually it is a classic albeit a minor one	1
1745	while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years there have always been rivals to their supremacy when this review was written in 2009 for example companies like dreamworks and to a lesser extent warner brothers and ardman were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney dominance back in the beginning in that late  30s and early  40s heyday when disney was serving cinematic banquets like snow white dumbo and fantasia the competition was provided by brothers dave and max fleischer despite releasing two very commendable films they never quite cornered the market ¬ñ many attribute their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town released the same week as the attack on pearl harbour which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty in a patch of overgrown garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger humans use the land as a shortcut discarding litter and cigars and other hazards right on top of the bugs  homes as they go honey shop owner mr bumble voiced by jack mercer fears that the future is bleak and wonders how she will ever be able to raise her daughter honey voiced by pauline loth in more secure surroundings a highly unscrupulous creature bagley c beetle voiced by tedd pierce offers to provide her a safer place to live if she will accept her hand in marriage but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart the perennially cheerful and optimistic hoppity voiced by stan freed hoppity believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better but is left looking foolish when bagley beetle and her pair of comical sidekicks manipulate the crisis to their own devious end only at the very end as their patch becomes the foundation for a huge new skyscraper do the bugs switch loyalty back to hoppity as they look to her to lead them a new safe home away from the destructive influence of humans what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation ¬ñ all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal the bumbling villains swat the fly and smack the mosquito hilarious names if you stop to think about it are particularly memorable equally admirable is the storytelling drive ¬ñ even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time it skillfully conveys a message for older audiences about the way human carelessness can impact upon the survival of wildlife time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film and when viewing it the audience needs to accept and forgive these occasional signs of general age and wear but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished funny and very slickly presented animation with a worthy message to boot	1
1746	wow i saw this movie and up on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters i saw mr bug first and was then totally disappointed in up s follow up what a beautiful and touching film movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be irking with their melodramatic acting and dialog but as animation the same melodrama and groaning humor can be wonderful and the soft organic lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters ladybugs grasshoppers bees snails stinkbugs flies mosquitoes beetles crickets and more each with all their own cute little but not overbearing idiosyncrasies the interaction with the human world from nemesis cigar smokers high heel wearers innocent kick the can playing kids to the kind hearted and to the unknown destroyers is realistic and fascinating you care for the bugs and dick and mary the protagonist hoppity is not some perfect superman who comes to set things right but a starry eyed optimist who leads everyone down the garden path literally and every time you think it s going to end happily in 1930s style along comes another roadblock i was on the edge of my seat much more than with up i walked out of the movie theater grinning and chuckling something that hasn t happened in a long long long long time	1
1747	there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on dvd be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies aroundi got a very good copy by a company called flashbacks and its quite good in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour very much better than some would have you believe the songs are delightful and the colour is great interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies i loved hoppity and the villain mr beatle is a real cad its incredibly imaginative the way inanimate objects like cotton reels old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great the anthropomorhic use of insects is amazing considering the much malinged creatures most people sadly think are repugnant hopefully we may never step on an insect again the insects enemy is man in reality of course its the insects that will survive no matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in australia they keep coming back the battle has been lost and we have to live with them there are several scenes that stand out such as when hoppity and mr bumble are caught in a watering can the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming the human characters look very like the ones in gulliver and its incredibly effective the wedding scene looks beautiful its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic the only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed the verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script its great and kids will love it its a joy to look at there s a very clever ending too	1
1748	normally i am a typical creepy crawly hatin  girl but after watching this film on youtube of course i m having different perspectives and also i did not know that my favorite animation studio   fleischer s made another film that s about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans lighted cigars and cigarette buttsfootstepsetc and how a plucky young grasshopper named hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of honey the bee i love the lovely ms honey you know after watching the film the bugs reminded me of the some of the jitter bugs from don bulth s thumbelina and out of the songs in the film i love we re a couple in the castle when i sing that song it almost made me cry this wonderful film was the second and final feature to come out of the fleischer studio the film was originally going to be released on november of 1941 but since the fleischer s rival disney released dumbo weeks earlier paramount changed the date to december of the same year but mr bug unfortunately went into a then unrealized trap of terrible timing having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on pearl harbor mr bug was a financial disaster and led to the ousting of max and dave fleischer from the studio they had established in 1919 and reorganized the company as famous studios another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes how sad it was overall i love both films from the fleischer bros   gulliver and mr bug	1
1749	people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer you may be thinking to yourself well if it s so great why haven t i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title bugville it s funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movie s main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time our grasshopper hero hoppity desperately wants to help her endangered community problem each time she tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck she fails miserablyand slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people she s trying to save although she does her best to maintain a positive outlook she occasionally breaks down and it s only through the encouragement and support of her friends that she gets back on her feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient okay you re saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done  my answer partially it s not just the message that makes this movie special it s the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don t even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i don t think you ll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you ll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah they re rotten no goodniks but you still care about them that s the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don t think they were intended to be malicious but they re there regardless they didn t bother me but it d be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go	1
1750	when hoppity goes to town she discovers nothing but bad news for her little insect neighbors in the lowlands can this honest good natured grasshopper save her sweetheart miss honey bee from the machinations of the evil c bagley beetle   and also lead her friends to a safe new home   before it s too late while not one of the great animated features a very new art at the time this film was created hoppity is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers technically it is well made with animation of a generally high quality the movie s main drawback is that none of the characters really have any `heart    they don t come `alive  on the screen in the way jiminy cricket did a year earlier in pinocchio however it is ultimately unfair to compare the fleischer studio output with that of disney max & dave fleischer had their own star to follow their contribution   and it would be a considerable one   would be in the realm of the one reel cartoon with their popeye and betty boop series they created alternate realities as viable as any produced by other cartoon studios hoppity was their second experiment with feature length animation after gulliver s travels in 1939 and henceforth they would expend their energies again on the cartoon short subject in fact the first in the highly acclaimed superman series was already in release hoppity s story owes a great deal to frank capra with it s energetic go get ¬ëem hero up against powerful societal forces indeed the film s original title was mr bug goes to town which immediately puts one in mind of gary cooper or jimmy stewart and their capraesque adventures jack mercer famous as the voice of popeye here speaks for two very different characters old mr bumble & swat the fly movie mavens should be able to catch veteran voice actors pinto colvig & mae questel both in uncredited roles the film has some pleasant songs supplied by hoagy carmichael & frank loesser of which `be my little baby bumble bee  is the most familiar `we re the couple in the castle  is a fine romantic tune which deserves to be rediscovered it is unfortunate that the film s initial animation with its sweep out of the heavens and past the in depth new york skyline is obscured behind the opening credits	1
1751	well i may be bias as i grew up watching a vhs copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a dvd copy as a birthday pressie for my dad the film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages much better than anything disney ever made in my opinion and i used to work in the disney store the characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding especially the musical talents of swat the fly and smack the mosquito and the amazing night club scene the musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst baby sitting and in fact every child i know thanks to my hoppity loving parents have seen this film many times it will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant baddy and over all originality	1
1752	mr bug goes to town was the last major achievement the fleischer studios produced the quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film the music and lyrics by frank loesser and hoagy carmichael with assistance by flieshcer veteran sammy timberg are quite good but not as much as the scoring of the picture by leigh harline who also scored snow white for disney harline s atmospheric music is superb and a treat for the ears the layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it s time and once again the fleischer s background artists outdid themselves the techincolored beauty of the film cannot be denied and while hoppity the grasshopper is the star the characters of swat the fly and smack the mosquito steal the picture swat s voicing by jack mercer of popeye fame is priceless kenny gardner brother in law of guy lombardoand a featured vocalist in her banddoes her usual pleasant job in the role of dick dickinsen the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons the fleischer studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product the movie is tuneful the story great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs scrambling for their lives upon a rising skyscraper is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film also don t fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max fleischer s remarkable 3 d sterioptical process which took four months to construct and employed 16000 tiny panes of glass in the electrified buildings of manhattan do not miss mr bug goes to townaka hoppity goes to town i ll wager you ll be bug eyed at the results	1
1753	hoppity is a charming if slightly phycadelic animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well now i have to admit i have a soft spot for  hoppitygoes to town  as it is called in the united kingdom having watched a vhs version taped of the tv by our parents many times with my siblingsimagine my surprise when i woke up this morning just in time to catch it on channel four at 0615 never the less the film was just as delightful as i remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to parents and children alike maybe one day i to shall share this forgotten classic with children of my own with a nice running time for kids 88 min sand a simple yet involving storyline there really is something for everyone in this tale of the little guy coming good i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi take note pixar	1
1754	what i liked best about this feature length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s it s the songs the clothing automobiles buildings lingo of the day etc you feel like you ve stepped back into time from reading some of the reviews here i see this was a hard luck film being released a couple of days before the pearl harbor attack wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days i m sure too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost 70 years ago the colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by hoppity and and her beautiful girl honey to make it happily ever after and out of harm s way it s also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them there is a nasty villain though   c bagley beetle   and two of her henchmen those helpers swat the fly and smack the mosquito are comedians complete with their brooklyn ese accents the story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand the good guy meanwhile has the decked stacked against her but in the very end of course prevails my favorite part   this will sound worse than what it was   was when good guy hoppity got temporarily electrocuted and she danced in black and white that was fantastic animation  you know it s a good thing i didn t see this as a very little kid i would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug people you never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet	1
1755	i have viewed this cartoon as a child a father and now a grand father it is my favorite cartoon i love the characters the great little tunes and the very good drawings i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon i think it is a beautiful little cartoon everyone i have shown it to simply loves it it is too bad it opened on such a bad day pearl harbor bombing if it wasn t for the bad timing it would have been a great success i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don t do it justice i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result they will just love it 	1
1756	hello again i have been thinking about this movie all my life i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles california in 1942 what a wonderful story of being good to one another kindness and charity you forget it is the bugs relating to one another it was just as if they were people i love this movie and so do my adult children such beautiful color in this moviei need to see this movie again there is a story about an envelope in the movie that i just can t remember the why of it thanks for listening	1
1757	i have for years remembered a song just a couple in a castle no twenty moonbeam square just a couple in castle in the air i couldn t find the song but i remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs i located a reference to the movie on the web i had seen the movie when i was only 9 year old at the ligonier pa theatre i was pleased to find that it had kenny gardner the singer with guy lombaro i am a lombardo fan and then to see that it was produced by the fleisher bros who did another very good full lengh cartoon feature of gullivar s travels also remembered fondly also the songs were associated with hoagy carmichael and frank loesser who are among the very best no wonder i remembered the film the song and the colorful animation as a full lengh musical this is a movie which should be remembered as a one of the best of the early full lengh musicals now that i remember it the plot may not have been earth shaking but was very well presented and makes for a easy to watch abd delightful movie	1
1758	mr bug goes to town was one of those films that i grew up hearing about however a copy could never be obtained until now i just watched this film on dvd and thought it was a delightful and charming film with wonderful animation a good plot and great songs if this film was made by disney then the film would be considered a classic however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone the film has slipped through the cracks the film was made by the max fleischer studios at their miami fl studios and was released through paramount pictures the film was to have had its premiere on dec 7th 1941 the date of the bombing of pearl harbor though this probably did hurt the release of the film the film did play at some movie theaters for up to a year as evidenced by doing some research the film was called a family favorite by most of the major american newspapers the film continued to be re released about every year or so usually around holidays like easter at least in major cities in the mid 1950s this film was re released under a new name hoppity goes to town named after the lead character in the film the film is a true period piece capturing a slice of americana as it was back in the late 30s and 1940 s the animation is great and many of the characters are very cute the animation of the humans in the film is via the rotoscope process meaning that actors were filmed and then that footage was traced over by animators giving the movement a very real look the fleishcher studios were one of several animation studios making animated cartoons back in the 30s and 40s while some of the fleischer characters like betty boop popeye and the superman cartoons are better known the work of the studio is more or less forgotten almost as a whole the body of work of the fleischer studios are in the public domain all of the superman cartoons are public domain all but one of the color classics series are public domain and the film gulliver s travels is also in the public domain this film never appears to have been released in the us on vhs or dvd but was released in europe however some looking around on the internet can very quickly produce you with a copy i recommend the search	1
1759	i first watched this in black and white circa christmas in the early sixties when it was shown on british television i was absolutely hooked and watched it over again whenever it was repeated on tv possibly two or three times only as it happens   if only we d had video recorders then as outlined by other contributors the plot describes the return of hoppity the grasshopper after a period spent away to a forties american city she finds that all is not as she left it and her good insect friends who live in the  lowlands  just outside the garden which belongs to a songwriter and her wife are now under threat from the  human ones  who are trampling through the broken down fence which prefaces the property using it as a shortcut insect houses are being flattened by their feet and are also often burned by cast away cigar butts and matches old mr bumble and her beautiful daughter honey hoppity s childhood sweetheart are in grave danger of losing their honey shop to this threat to compound their problems devious insect  property magnate  c bagley beetle has romantic designs on honey bee herself and hopes with the help of her henchmen swat the fly and smack the mosquito to force bumble to give her her hand in marriage will the heroic and fearless hoppity win the day and manage to save the community of bugs from their dastardly fate and especially her precious honey from hers enjoy the classic songs katy did katy didn t is a superb swinging upbeat example and the colourful visuals as the tale unfolds time has not blunted my fascination for this masterpiece of animation and story telling and i was much pleased to find that it had been released to video although i later found out that it was in ntsc pal format never mind i sent off for the video immediately and only then bought a portable tv video combination complete with ntsc playback i have enjoyed many nostalgic viewings since then and have even discovered that the tv rights have switched from bbc who informed me they were unlikely to ever show the film on any of their stations to filmfour who have at last been showing it on their digital stations in early 2007 my granddaughter aged three was absolutely entranced while we watched it together   and this is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer generated productions i would thoroughly recommend this film for any age and especially the youngest of viewers give max fleischer a posthumous oscar	1
1760	leslie carbaga s excellent book on the fleishers tells the whole story of the fleischer s big move of their entire animation unit to florida and their subsequent ejection by paramount  mr bug goes to town didn t destroy the animation pioneers  credit with paramount although it s often told that way and this was paramount s favorite version of the story according to carbaga the big studio more than anything wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether mr bug provided them the pretext to do just that   the sad closing of a great quirky innovative chapter in american animation i wanted to comment also that the film actually debuted december 4 1941 not december 7 that may have been close enough to do the trick anyway in terms of national mood damaging the film s success but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time dumbo released october 23 1941 was still doing very brisk holiday business i haven t done the research into box office numbers but i d say that dumbo s concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr bug movie going was at an all time high at this period and successful films could go strong in theaters for months    something unimaginable in these typically short run quick to dvd days	1
1761	hoppity goes to town was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave fleischer who created a parallel universe to disney while disney s films are well remembered today both of the fleischer films gulliver s travels and this one are forgotten hoppity is a spellbinding original not an adaptation like the first picture that is a major plus one would think no the critics rarely on the fleischers  sides to begin with tore into them for this yes the story is not as tight as gulliver but how can you hate a film that flaunts itself so joyfully it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story which would be a crime to reveal the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film the fleischers  really outdid themselves here and never quite did so again most of their time would be devoted to one reelers after this tanked at the box office it s a shame they didn t continue making features who knows their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for **** out of 4 stars	1
1762	a pity nobody seems to know this little thriller masterpiece where bigger budgeted movies fail terminal choice delivers lots of thrills shocks and bloody violence a little seen gem that deserves being searched for in your local video shop that anonymous guy beneath is quite right when she says you ll never trust hospitals again it is that effective  good endingtoo not really a twist but it doesn t end the way one thought it would yep that s ellen barkin in an early role	1
1763	could this be one of the earliest colour films it s actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of her other films i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film it s just beautiful you are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the day great this may not have a plot or anything very interesting but this is the second colour film ever i recommend this to everyone especially if you re teaching students about filming or something of the sort you have to show them what began color films	1
1764	like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short  lasting about one minute so because of its brevity it s not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it s actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the prints were hand painted  making annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i ve actually seen two different versions  one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedly  it s just that visually compelling and odd if you want to see it online there is a 36 second version on google video type in serpentine dance	1
1765	in this approximately 34 second thomas edison produced short we see annabelle moore performing the loie fuller choreographed serpentine dance in two different fantastical flowing robes moore was one of the bigger stars of the late victorian era she was featured in a number of edison company shorts including this one which was among the first kinetoscope films shown in london in 1894 loie fuller had actually patented the serpentine dance which moore performs here in robes as well as entire frames that are frequently hand tinted in the film presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era supposedly the moore films were popular enough to have to be frequently redone including refilming the version available to us now may be a later version remake moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party at a restaurant in new york city she later went on to star as the gibson bathing girl in the ziegfeld follies in 1907 she appeared there until 1912 the short is notable for its framing of motion which especially during the second half becomes almost abstract it somewhat resembles a morris louis painting even though this is almost 60 years before louis  relevant work you should be able to find this short on dvd on a number of different anthologies of early films	1
1766	i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating it s a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomery s mission places her in some very improbable situations and she s just the man for the job she maintains her trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays her precocious eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddly among the glut of b movies from the late 1940 s and 1950 s once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for	1
1767	this is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos it is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing embedded in the marvellous array of characters a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score and witty light direction from montgomery herself this is one to watch over and over montgomery is a bit part actor who finds herself assigned by her military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante s home to discover the identity of her former beau a suspected jewel thief while the premise is rather preposterous the results are hilarious montgomery is the befuddled plant ann blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed terribly earnest debutante and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress jane cowl s lawyer mother to lillian randolph s take charge maid   are all fabulous oddly enough this only earned an oscar nom for sound when it deserved top nods for direction screenplay and musical score do not miss it   it s one of hollywood s best	1
1768	i like the good things in life as much as anybody i suppose but until about five years ago opera didn t figure into my entertainment choices oh i made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about i d watched several television productions    notably parts of wagner s ring cycle on public television    hoping to understand other people s fascination with the art form and i knew i could like parts of various operas i remember being surprised as a kid that i actually liked the snippets of madame butterfly in my geisha and i enjoyed the opera scenes in moonstruck and pretty woman but unlike the characters in those films i just didn t get it then in 1995 i saw a live performance of rigoletto presented by the new york city opera company and that night i got it what a wonderful glorious pageant of color and music and raw emotion and i do mean emotion with a capital e the key i think is that the operatic music allows the performers to over act freely and believably in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken everything hinges on the music of course and when the music is magical as it is in rigoletto an opera can be a magnificent entertainment a sympathetic family member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 tv production of the opera and i ve found that since i can t see live performances of rigoletto live on a regular basis this video version is a fine substitute luciano pavarotti is perfect in the part of the duke ingvar wixell is excellent as her mean spirited court jester rigoletto and rigoletto s beloved daughter gilda is played by the somewhat plain featured edita gruberova the sets and costumes are lavish and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the story that could never be matched on a stage if you ve never seen rigoletto or if you think you don t like or understand opera i urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it if you don t like this if this production of rigoletto doesn t make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera well just give it up and move on to something else but i suspect if you re new to opera as i was that you ll be pleasantly surprised bill anderson	1
1769	pavarotti and the entire cast are superb in this beautifully filmed opera by giuseppe verdi the world s finest composer of operas the coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with her perfect pitch the title role is well enacted and well sung the entire production is as perfect as one could expect a masterpiece of cinematography 	1
1770	the cast for this production of rigoletto is excellent edita gruberova sings gilda magnificently and passionately luciano pavarotti also sings splendidly vergara is a fine maddalena fedora barbieri is a famous older singer who sings the maid giovanna weikl sings marullo wixell sings both rigoletto and monterone as rigoletto wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this hard to beat ensemble of great singers kathleen kuhlmann in the contessa all principals are well known and world renowned this is an exciting rigoletto visually as well as musically i have it on both laser disc and dvd you should have it too	1
1771	i saw this movie when i was very young living in houston texas i really enjoyed this movie and i wrote to jean peters in hollywood and i told her how much i enjoyed seeing her in this movie she sent me an autographed photo this movie was directed by jacques tourneur and besides jean peters in the starring role it also stars louis jourdan debra paget and herbert marshall it was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long jean peters was married to howard hughes she also starred in viva zapata with marlon brando anthony quinn who won an oscar for playing the role zapata s brother marlon brando starred as zapata 1952 and she also starred in captain from castile 1947 with tyron power since then i ve been trying to find a place where it is available but so far i have not been successful does anybody have any suggestions about where i can find and purchase this movie it this comment contains spoilers i am unaware of it	1
1772	sometimes it s hard to be a piratebut by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying   and it showsparticularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard mr thomas gomez   eminently hissablewhen the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male   dominated society but i have serious doubts that either mtourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time it was an excitingentertaining family film with absolutely no pretensionshidden meanings or alternative agendait was fun mlouis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctormr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun but it is miss peters who stays in the memorywilfully adolescentilliteratetough but vulnerablewonderfully agileand ultimatelycourageousshe is everybody s idea of a lady pirate there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles   that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret	1
1773	this is one of several period sea faring yarns of its era which has the added distinction although not in itself unique of a female buccaneer at its center at first both leads ‚Äì jean peters and louis jourdan ‚Äì might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually thanks no doubt to the talented players herbert marshall thomas gomez and james robertson justice who support them velvety voiced marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the ship‚Äôs obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and gomez is suitably larger than life as blackbeard the pirate the cast is completed by debra paget as jourdan‚Äôs wife who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom jourdan instills the first pangs of love which however does not spare her the occasional flogging or sword wound incidentally the film was the second exotic teaming of jourdan and paget in one year following delmer daves‚Äô bird of paradise the direct result of this unexpected softening of anne‚Äôs character is her falling out with blackbeard‚Äôs crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded jourdan paget and marshall while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type jacques tourneur‚Äôs energetic direction and franz waxman‚Äôs grandiose score ensure an above average effort that moves along at a brisk pace incidentally tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior burt lancaster vehicle the flame and the arrow 1950 as usual with vintage technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating by the way differing running times are given for this film 81 or 87 minutes and for the record the version i watched was the shorter one	1
1774	this movie was much better than i expected ++++ jean peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights to the extent she may have a double doing the action it s hard to tellbut peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it and doing it well ++++ with a good and serious script this could have been an excellent film but it s basically cheesy still entertaining however ++++ not up to a regular jacques tournier film but definitely above a regular jean peters film color is typical of this  50s time period ie too garish and not realistic the actors for blackbeard and her first mate and the drunken doctor were good louis jordan was a bit weak i don t think debra paget was right either but certainly jean peters and debra paget were probably the two best looking female stars in the  50s	1
1775	i like the film it¬¥s the best pirate movie i watched hitherto forget silly errol flynn stuff and pirates of the caribbean this movie is wonderful melancholic i compare it with johnny guitar at the sea side but 3 years earlier two women fighting for a man where mad love might lead one the character of the female anti  heroine anne providence is superb acting without compromise like a child lost alone on her search for a own female identity in a real man¬¥s world she¬¥s a quite strange movie hero not a funny pirate as most of her companions in this genre not making jokes all the time fighting for the poor and good and only killing the stupid spanish or british soldiers or   better   sly governors but she¬¥s murdering all the poor prisoners of war after she captured a ship look careful at this at the start of the movie she¬¥s primitive she can¬¥t even read she is desperated and she get¬¥s an alcoholic she looses all her friends as consequence of her obstinacy and she¬¥s wearing rags most of the film this film shows a pirate hero a little  bit as she or in this case she but there has been a female anne buccaneer anne boney might have been in brutal reality the film is quite short and the story is told in a breathtaking manner certainly a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for present time viewers the ships swim very obvious in a bath tube but this real drama about love that kills trust betrayal revenge hatred and sacrifice drives one crazy maybe anne is even supposed to be judas iskarioth and jesus from nazareth in one person being betrayed by her friend the french larochelle as jesus after being disappointed by the friend delivering her to a death penalty as judas than getting remorse about this like judas who commits suicide according to the gospel of matthew and in the end sacrificing herself for the rescue of the beloved enemy as jesus but even if you are not interested in this philosophical questions of guilt and atonement the film brings a lot of cheap action as sword fights and burning plastic ships for a very short one and a half hour	1
1776	directed by jacques tourneur cat people out of the past night of the demon and written by phillip dunne how green was my valley anne of the indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie its main character of captain anne providence is based on a real woman pirate anne boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th century s atlantic the film begins with the sea battle where anne s jean peters pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to europe from the south america as a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome french officer pierre la rochelle louis jourdan who is taken prisoner anne ends up falling in love with her and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it s only till she sets her free when she discovers that she has a beautiful young wife molly debra paget with whom she pretty much in love with anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead the pirate movie clich√© figure of `black beard  also makes her appearance here this time played by thomas gomez though anne of the indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clich√©s it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by jacques tourneur 7 10	1
1777	it would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of hollywood peopleit was in 1988 that chuck norris saw this film at cannes international film festivalhe made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in her hollywood films with her as a potent action starhe was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in kieslowski s film by a reckless psychopath who hits her cruelly with a big stonethere should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human societythis is the reason why chuck norris  statement appears as a cruel joke which defends violent means in a society which is increasing becoming restlessan honest reviewer would not be making a mistake if she she states that kieslowski s film dekalog dekalogpiec #15 has universal connotationsthis is because the events depicted in dekalog 5 can happen in any part of worldthe best lesson which kielowski gives to us concerns levels of violence which are acceptable in a just societythis is the reason why the brutal slaying of an innocent cab driver is capable of causing a feeling of repugnance in uswe would not feel the same hatred for homicide when it appears in films featuring arnold schwarzeneggerchuck norris and jean claude van damme as they appear much too artificialone can easily grasp that special effects and modern studio techniques can charm only toddlers but make no sense to serious film enthusiastskieslowski also champions helplessness of human beings in rescuing fellow humans beings from the clutches of death and miserythis is particularly interesting as time and again it has been proved that strict laws and capital punishments have not been able to prevent homicide	1
1778	a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment from the preparation of the gallow to the victim p***ing in her own pants before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty the whole dekalog originated from this story the dekalog screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused	1
1779	 identity¬ñ     i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it s being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what s inside our identity is everything that s ever happened to us  ntozake shange qtd in fires in the mirror pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me i felt that if i accepted them than i would be compromising something what i thought before really isn t worth getting into i understand what naturalism is trying to say i experienced a tangible katharsis and one that fell into existence piecemeal and one that s still alive that i still have to reckon with it s still working inside me  the film wasn t sympathetic per se it doesn t need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing there are certainly wicked people whether or not they should die is for another film what decalogue shows is that good beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up  the  science  of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v it s not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before but i see now the worth in making art like this to  make  people or perhaps to make people do something  there s a method to lazar s compromise of her    light much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect this should not be too strange of an idea after all how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect i wince when i say it but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself  this ruin this process this natural process makes me want to buck the system   i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods instead i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments that we are of course free to ignore we can ignore it all we want if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury  for surely despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters  likely and catastrophic fate they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what s to be done with what they see as has been mentioned there s danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone there s danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesn t correspond to their world view and i don t think that the  hopeful  need be either wealthy or fortunate i have not seen it but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort there are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is who grieve because they can t find anything that separates them from their landscape  landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed but in reality landscapes do not enact they change sure and dramatically but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over but it cannot be changed itself	1
1780	the dekalog 5 may be considered a violent accusation against the death sentence according to the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill not by chance it puts the concept of a state fully complied with the provisions of an unjust law on the same plane as the figure of a murderer but the law might not imitate the nature it might correct it states piotr the counsel for the defense a real catalyst character the punishment is a form of vengeance aiming at returning evil for evil without preventing the crime but in the name of whom the law takes its revenge really in the name of the innocent ones the horrifying and detailed sequences of the last half hour of a man sentenced to death give value to the uselessness of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty with the purpose of intimidating all potential criminals desperate plights don t demand desperate remedies kieslowski says in her message teaching us how unrighteous can be the act of disobedience to a commandment of god that judges punishment the same way as crime is judged there are three different moral attitudes here the innate sense of rebellion of the murderer aiming at rousing the hostile torpor of the surrounding environment the strong sense of chronic indifference of the victim inclined to laugh at other people s requirements the deserving behavior of the counsel for the defense always ready to fight against adversity in favor of human life the struggle for life is ruthlessly vivisected all of the time the characters are plunged into scenes of affliction and distress in an urban landscape accented with greenish tones and seen in its own reflections through the windshield of a taxi everything in dekalog 5 conveys a dreadful sense of estrangement and isolation descriptions of a waste undergrowth of violence and folly scenes of precarious conditions of work sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous aura of desolation aimless wanderings through disenchanting environments jazek the main character is compelled to struggle with an opponent stronger than herself a town completely wrapped in profound indifference apparently hostile deaf to all her mute calls for help while a faded photo of a little girl in a first communion dress goes on gnawing her soul she s irremediably directing her steps towards a disconnected route to damnation seen through the deformations of the 18 mm wide angle camera lens aiming at distorting every details altering the reality making it fade out in remote and alien echoes kieslowski doesn t bring extenuating circumstances seasoned with honey tongued tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant differently from some hollywood stereotypes like i want to live by robert wise she doesn t slip on the banana peel of useless pathetic scenes to extenuate jazek s guilt and to mitigate the brutality of the crime not interested at all in proximate psychological motivations to justify any display of extreme or violent behaviors and refusing to include any useless judicial proceedings in other words in kieslowsky s opinion a crime is always a crime according to the principle of par condicio she puts the prosecutor on the same plane as the condemned man using many signs or symbols to represent a society seen in the most sinister light and we can t remain indifferent even if we don t agree with her jazek s screams of anguish touch our hearts with pity in the same manner that terri schiavo s entreating eyes do	1
1781	dekalog five was an interesting viewing experience for me because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience three men are the focus of this chapter and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad in one s case almost overwhelmingly bad with such vile characters i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment however when the time comes for the murder and it s subsequent effect on the murderer kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view are you not as guilty as this man this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of dekalog five that much more profound as kieslowski as usual doesn t stay within the literal confines of her theme just as the other parts of the dekalog don t take their commandment s theme in it s literal sense neither does dekalog five it asks us what is murder who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment if any it s a fantastic film and typical of kieslowski absolutely stunning	1
